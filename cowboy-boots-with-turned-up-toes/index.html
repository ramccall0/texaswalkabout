This isn’t just for show either, the winning groups of these contests have been known to win up to $500 in prize money.</p><p>The more popular dance troupes have been hired to entertain for bachelorette parties and even weddings.</p><h2><strong>What are pointed toe cowboy boots called?</strong></h2><p><strong>It depends on the type of pointed toe.</strong></p><p>The pointed toe was originally made for versatility. Today, it serves much of the same function, and not just for getting your foot into a stirrup.</p><p>If a boot has a very sharp point, it’s referred to as <a href="https://stageswest.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-toe-shape-for-your-boots/">"needle pointed."</a>. If the toe has a tip that’s slightly blunted instead, it’s then referred to as a “snip toe.” Anything in-between those types is called “J toe.”</p><p>There’s also the <a href="https://www.ariat.com/al/cowboy-boots-square-toe-vs-pointed-toe">square toe</a>, a kind of boot that’s used for general outdoor work. Whereas the traditional pointed toe is used for both horse riding and formal events, the square toe can also be used as a dress boot as well as anything that involves constant walking.</p><p>Some other types include the cutter toe, the round toe, and the regular square. The name is defined as such, depending on the amount of foot space that each boot allows.</p><p>Should any of these kinds interest you, look at your own foot size to determine which kind of cowboy boot toe is best.</p><p>Anything with a pointy tip will usually be a bit tighter, and might require a certain level of swagger just to pull off.</p><p>If you’re looking for something more casual, it’s recommended that you pick a more blunt-tipped style of boot to allow more foot room, and therefore, more comfort.</p><p>Unless you’re a hardcore rancher or do a lot of horse-back riding, getting pointed tipped boots may not be a good idea. The thinner tip has been known to make general walking uncomfortable, so before you decide on buying a pair of any kind of cowboy boots, make sure you know what you’ll use them for.</p><h2><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2><p>Now that you have equipped yourself with a bit more knowledge than you had before, you might be more confident in trying out some turned-up cowboy boots yourself. Or, if you’re bold enough, grab a pair of flashy trival boots and join a Mexican dancing troupe.</p><p>Whereas style is important for various reasons, pick a type that’s most comfortable for you and your purposes. You don’t want to find yourself out on the ranch or on the dance floor just to have your toes start aching with pain after an hour or so of use.</p><p>Regardless of your personality or reasons, know that the pointed tip on cowboy boots is there for a reason, and not just an expression of fashion. The style itself may change depending on cultural fads, or even to serve some practical purpose we are not yet aware of, but know that pointed toes will be hanging around for quite a while.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
