            "content_html": "<p>Wearing cowboy boots is a fashion statement. Whether you’re a guy or gal, you want to look your best while wearing this iconic western-style footwear. You hear that Levis is a good brand of jeans to pair with. Yet, is that true? In this article, we’ll discuss the answer to that question and more!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What are the best Levis to wear with cowboy boots? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>For 2022, there are 20 types to choose from.</strong></p>\n<p>This year there’s a huge selection of Levis for men and women <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/best-levis-for-cowboy-boots/\">both</a>. Some types include Levi’s 501, 505, and 541.</p>\n<p>Before the 1900s, Levis were considered “pants for the poor,” and were generally not favored by real cowboys. However, not long after, people began preferring the “rugged” kind of Levi jeans, such as straight-leg or boot-cut. These types allow the wearer to fit cowboy boots underneath the jean leggings.</p>\n<p>With that being said, there is no real “best” kind of Levis to wear. It depends on your body type and what type of cowboy boots you want to pair with jeans. For example, the Levi’s Men’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=Levi%27s+Men%27s+513+Slim+Straight+Jean&amp;linkCode=gs3&amp;tag=fromthegues0f-20\">Slim Straight Jean</a> isn’t ideal for cowboy boots with extra-wide shafts. A pair of boot-cut jeans would work better in those circumstances.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What can you wear with cowboy boots and jeans? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Keep it simple, unless you’re Texan.</strong></p>\n<p>Unless you plan to work on a ranch very soon, the rule of thumb is to stick with <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/style/shoes/cowboy-boots/\">one western-themed</a> piece of clothing with your cowboy boots and jeans. Unless you want people to immediately think “Cowboy” when they see you, try to keep your attire casual.</p>\n<p>Clothing like plain collared shirts or decorative belt buckles are known to pair well with just about any jean and cowboy boots combination. A couple of things to avoid for casual cowboy boot wearers are cowboy hats and spurs.</p>\n<p>However, depending on the scene you’ll be showing off in, such as a big city or rural area, dress appropriately for your environment.</p>\n<p>For cities, it’s better if your outfit appears more “dressier” than someone who’s about to go to a rodeo. Out in the country, feel free to wear more than one piece of western-themed clothing, especially in states such as Texas.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What Levis do cowboys wear? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Actually, real cowboys wear Wranglers!</strong></p>\n<p>According to one <a href=\"https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/levis-vs-wrangler-best-cowboy-jeans\">Texas journalist</a>, it’s much better to wear a tough pair of Wrangler jeans around the real deal. Those folk consider others who wear Levis “drugstore cowboys,” and won’t be getting complimented anytime soon.</p>\n<p>This isn’t just a brand preference in itself. Real cowboys use the “barbed-wire test” with their jeans. They claim that a pair of Wrangler jeans won’t rip on barbed-wire, whereas a pair of Levis will.</p>\n<p>However, it shouldn’t really matter which brand you go with. Both Wrangler and Levis can work with cowboy boots if you choose the right accessories to go with them.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What cut of jeans should I wear with cowboy boots? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Boot-Cut, Wide/Relaxed Fit, and Regular/Straight Leg.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s not so much a matter of whether you <em>should</em> or not, but what feels the <a href=\"https://www.ariat.com/al/how-to-wear-cowboy-boots-and-jeans-men\">most comfortable</a>. As mentioned earlier, you’ll need enough pant-leg space to work with just about any pair of cowboy boots out there.</p>\n<p>A quick way to tell what <em>doesn’t</em> work is if you can’t slip your jeans over the boots in the first place. Experts recommend avoiding <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/best-levis-for-cowboy-boots/\">slim jeans</a>, for both men and women. These are different from <em>skinny</em> jeans, which can work when tucking the legs into cowboy boots.</p>\n<p>If your boots are very wide at the shafts, consider getting boot-cut jeans. As the name implies, these jeans are designed to accommodate most boots.</p>\n<p>Regular/straight leg and wide/relaxed fit are okay as well, but you might have to put in a little extra effort to fit those jeans together with your cowboy boots. Again, pick out whatever combination feels comfortable to wear.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>How should pants be worn with cowboy boots? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>In general, keep the boots tucked inside your jeans.</strong></p>\n<p>Unless you’re doing <a href=\"https://www.ariat.com/al/how-to-wear-cowboy-boots-and-jeans-men\">heavy-duty work</a>, a good rule of thumb is to keep your jean legs on the outside. Folks who tuck their jeans into their boots usually do so for <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/best-levis-for-cowboy-boots/\">safety purposes</a>.</p>\n<p>When riding a horse, cowboys will tuck in their jeans so they don’t get caught on anything while riding. This is especially important when getting in and out of the saddle.</p>\n<p>And for those working in rough outdoor conditions, avoid wearing baggy jeans. In fact, most rugged jobs will consider doing so unsafe!</p>\n<p>Otherwise, cowboy boots look better when you cover the shafts up with your jeans. Unless you plan to go full western, keep those boots tucked in.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>Remember, there is no “best” pair of Levis that will pair well with your cowboy boots. As we come in all shapes and sizes, so do the clothes we wear. Exercise careful judgement and pick out what works best for <em>you</em>.</p>\n<p>Also, be aware of the environment you’ll be wearing your combination in. Styles can vary greatly when comparing people who live in the country with those dwelling in big inner cities.</p>\n<p>Style is important, but won’t mean much if you’re uncomfortable in the clothing you wear. A pair of boot-cut jeans might work for the other person, but you may find them unbearable. It helps to try on several pairs of jeans and cowboy boots to find the right fit.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>Foot odor can be a real problem, especially when you're on your feet all day. Will wearing cowboy boots give you smelly feet? If your boots stink, what can you do? Do you have to wear socks? Will wearing cowboy boots cause other foot problems?</strong></p>\n<p>If you have questions about foot odor and cowboy boots, you'll find the answers you need below. Sweaty feet can be an issue when you wear boots, but thankfully, there are plenty of ways to prevent and deal with this problem.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Do Cowboy Boots Make Your Feet Stink?</h2>\n<p><strong>Cowboy boots won't always make your feet smell, but they can make your feet sweaty, which can lead to foot odor. This can be an issue with any type of closed shoe. Sweat is less likely to be a problem if you choose shoes made from natural, breathable materials, like leather boots with a fabric lining.</strong></p>\n<p>You can also reduce issues with sweat by wearing absorbent, moisture-wicking socks beneath your boots. Make sure that your boots fit you properly; ventilation can be an issue with tight boots. Choose comfortable boots that give your feet plenty of room to breathe.</p>\n<p>When you take your boots off at the end of the day, you should give them a chance to dry. You can place your boots next to a dehumidifier or invest in a boot dryer. Drying out your boots can evaporate sweat inside them, which can keep odor-causing bacteria from spreading.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>How Do You Get the Smell out of Cowboy Boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>If your cowboy boots already smell like sweaty feet, you can neutralize the odor by sprinkling a handful of baking soda in each boot. Let the boots sit overnight, and then shake out the baking soda. It can absorb odor-causing molecules, leaving your boots smelling fresh again.</strong></p>\n<p>If you don't have baking soda on hand, you can do the same thing with dryer sheets. Right after you remove your boots, line them with dryer sheets and let them sit for at least 12 hours. If you put the dryer sheets inside your boots while they're still warm, they'll be able to absorb more sweat.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Is It Okay to Wear Cowboy Boots Without Socks?</h2>\n<p><strong>You can wear cowboy boots without socks, but your feet will be more likely to sweat. One way to counteract this is to put moisture-wicking insoles inside your boots. The insoles will absorb some of the moisture from your feet, reducing sweat and odor.</strong></p>\n<p>Remember that not all insoles are created alike; gel insoles could actually cause your feet to sweat more. Only use absorbent insoles, and change them out as soon as you start to notice an odor. With the right insoles, you can skip socks and minimize foot sweat.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Is Wearing Cowboy Boots Good for Your Feet?</h2>\n<p><strong>Cowboy boots can be great for your feet, but it's important to remember that not all boots are the same. High-quality leather boots can keep your feet comfortable and provide support throughout the day. Cheap boots made from faux leather, on the other hand, won't let your boots breathe.</strong></p>\n<p>If you wear cowboy boots on a regular basis, it's worthwhile to invest in a pair of well-made boots that meet your needs. Look for leather with a heel between 1 and 1.5 inches. A boot with a higher heel could put pressure on your knees and interfere with your walking stride.</p>\n<p>Have your feet and calves measured before buying boots to make sure that your boots aren't too tight. If your boots are too tight to bend at the calf, it could cause muscular pain. Once you find the right boots, take the time to break them in before you wear them for long stretches of time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p><strong>Cowboy boots can cause your feet to sweat, which can cause foot odor. Thankfully, odor is less likely to be an issue with breathable leather boots. Moisture-wicking socks and insoles can also help to minimize sweating and bad smells. </strong></p>\n<p>If your boots still wind up smelling, you can take care of the odor with a little baking soda or dryer sheets. It's normal for feet to sweat, but with a few precautions, you can keep your feet from stinking up your favorite pair of cowboy boots.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>You’re thinking of getting a new pair of stylish cowboy boots. However, how the heck do you tell which pair is the right size? Can they be worn with jeans? In this article, we’ll answer those questions and more.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What's the ideal leg opening size for cowboy boots? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>About 20 and ¼ inches.</strong></p>\n<p>Even if you have the right leg opening, keep in mind that there are <a href=\"https://horseracingsense.com/wearing-mens-cowboy-boots-with-jeans/\">certain</a> ways you should consider when wearing jeans with cowboy boots. One thing you should avoid doing most of the time is tucking jeans into your boots, unless you’re working on the ranch or riding a horse and don’t want your pants to get too dirty.</p>\n<p>A highly recommended approach is to wear jeans over the boots, so that most of the shafts are covered. Some brands that work best for this are Ariat and Wranglers.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind the length of your jeans as well. You don’t want them too short or too long. If the pant legs are longer than you’d expect, then you run the risk of stepping on them with your boots. If too short, it will just look weird.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>How do you measure cowboy boot size? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Measure your feet in the store, or draw the length of each foot.</strong></p>\n<p>The easiest way would be to use a Brannock device, a tool that most footwear retailers use to determine a customer’s foot size. However, if you want to measure before heading out to the nearest boot store, consult this <a href=\"https://stageswest.com/blog/cowboy-boot-sizing-guide/\">sizing guide</a> to figure out which size works best for you.</p>\n<p>If you find out that you’re between sizes, it’s a good idea to go with the larger one when selecting a new pair of cowboy boots. Having a bit of extra room is always a nice thing to have, because you never know how much your feet can grow!</p>\n<p>Another thing, measure your feet at least once per year. Even if you have another pair of boots that you can get your size from, your feet won’t remain the same size for long, so measure them just in case.</p>\n<p>One other tip is to wear socks for measurements. Doing so can add ½ a size to your feet, and will get you closer to getting the right pair of boots.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>How much room should you have in cowboy boots? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Experts recommend leaving about 1/8<sup>th</sup> of an inch for the heel lift.</strong></p>\n<p>To be more specific, “heel lift” is the <a href=\"https://www.ariat.com/al/how-to-fit-cowboy-boots\">gap</a> between your heel and the insole of the boot you’re interested in. To achieve this, put a boot on, and then lift your heel up before measuring the gap with your fingers.</p>\n<p>Another thing to be aware of when sizing boots is to check for any extra room in the toe box. With the boot on, use a sideways thumb to see if it fits between the boot tip and your toes.</p>\n<p>Also, make sure the ball of your foot, the widest part of it, aligns with the boot’s outsole. The boots should feel snug, and not too tight.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Can you wear straight-leg jeans with cowboy boots? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Yep!</strong></p>\n<p>You can also wear <a href=\"https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-wear-boots-with-jeans#4-types-of-jeans-to-wear-with-boots\">other</a> kinds of jeans with cowboy boots too! However, guys may want to avoid wearing skinny jeans with their boots, as this fashion choice is more acceptable for gals.</p>\n<p>When it comes to style, don’t forget about choosing a nice color either. Usually darker colors pair well with cowboy boots.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>How should cowboy boots fit around my leg? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Make sure your calves are comfortable.</strong></p>\n<p>When considering the right size, it’s important to find out how a boot feels around your <a href=\"https://www.deephollowranch.com/how-should-cowboy-boot-fit/\">calf</a>. This should be immediately apparent once you slip the boot on. If you encounter too much resistance, that boot is too small for you.</p>\n<p>Don’t forget about your feet! If you put on an ideal pair of cowboy boots and are still unsure, walk around in them to see how they feel. Test out how the balls of your feet bend, and if your toes have a bit of extra space to move around in.</p>\n<p>Remember, you’ll have to break into most pairs of cowboy boots, and you need comfort (the right size!) to do so. Take your time and try things out.</p>\n<p>If it feels like your ankles are flying around inside, then that boot is too large. As cowboy boots don’t use laces, it’s all the more important that you can easily slip into them, and keep them on while you walk around.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>How are cowboy boots supposed to fit around the shin? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Again, find out how your calves feel in boots.</strong></p>\n<p>Your shins aren’t the ideal thing to focus on when sizing. It’s easier to gauge how boots fit around your legs by testing how much room your calves have.</p>\n<p>Try to leave a half-inch up to <a href=\"https://bootspy.com/how-should-cowboy-boots-fit/\">two inches</a> of space between your calves and the boot shafts. As long as your ankles don’t feel too loose when wearing cowboy boots, then a bit of extra space around the legs should be fine.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>When getting <em>any</em> new footwear, it’s important to know what size fits you best. Doing so will allow a much more comfortable experience, especially with leather cowboy boots.</p>\n<p>This is also important when matching them with a pair of jeans. Take your time to pick a pair that compliments the boots, and feels comfortable to wear.</p>",

Yet, what about those pair of cowboy boots in your closet? They’re quite reliable and stylish, but will they be tough enough for the hunts ahead? In this article, we’ll discuss whether you should or shouldn’t wear them while hunting, and what you can do to protect your feet from just about any hunting activity.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Are cowboy boots good for hunting? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>No, not really.</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, cowboy boots won’t serve you well in the wilderness when hunting game. This is due to their <a href=\"https://dresscodehub.com/wear-cowboy-boots-hunting/\">intended design</a>, which does not include protecting your feet from long hunts.</p>\n<p>The two major disadvantages cowboy boots have are their lack of grip on the outer soles and poor ankle support. This can be especially problematic if you choose to hunt off the beaten trail.</p>\n<p>Heavily wooded areas or desert can become incredibly slippery during or after a rain. Cowboy boots won’t help you with this, they’re simply not designed for any of that.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Should you wear cowboy boots while hunting? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>You can, but it’s generally not a good idea.</strong></p>\n<p>Even though there are various hunting <a href=\"https://dsgouterwear.com/blog/blaze-orange-hunting-requirements-by-state-usa/\">rules</a> in the US that all hunters must abide by, there’s virtually nothing saying you can’t wear cowboy boots on a hunt if you want to. Therefore, it’s your choice.</p>\n<p>Some people have recommended using <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/I-live-in-the-Appalachian-region-and-I-hunt-Are-cowgirl-western-boots-good-for-hunting-in-mountains-especially-walking-around-a-lot-trailing-outside-dogs\">roper-style</a> cowboy boots over traditional ones, due to their <a href=\"https://www.westernbootbarn.com.au/blog/the-history-of-cowboy-boots/\">lower</a> heel heights. Just in case, make sure any ropers you’re interested in also come with good grip.</p>\n<p>The primary subject here, however, is that it’s a better idea to wear boots for their intended <a href=\"https://www.idahostatejournal.com/outdoors/xtreme_idaho/yes-you-do-need-different-boots-for-different-activities/article_08fe4796-8969-5b24-bd43-35fbe20bd88f.html\">purposes</a>. Going for a hike? Hiking boots. Going on a hunt? Hunting boots, especially for colder weather.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the choice is yours, but don’t ignore your safety, either. You might be out in the wild for several hours on end. At the very least, cowboy boots can <em>technically</em> work if you walk on open trails, places that aren’t usually affected all too much by weather. Use careful judgement.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What boots do you wear for hunting? Boots for hunting. </strong></h2>\n<p>Hunting boots are used for hunting. Many are <a href=\"https://protips.dickssportinggoods.com/sports-and-activities/hunt-and-fish/learn-about-different-types-of-hunting-boots\">specially</a> designed for colder weather, have cleats in addition to heavy rubber grip, high ankles to protect the legs from bites and sharp brush, and insulating layers for sitting still on long winter hunts.</p>\n<p>However, be warned, they have a little extra <a href=\"https://decideoutside.com/hiking-boots-vs-hunting-boots/\">mass</a> than most outdoor shoes and boots. That’s right, <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/I-live-in-the-Appalachian-region-and-I-hunt-Are-cowgirl-western-boots-good-for-hunting-in-mountains-especially-walking-around-a-lot-trailing-outside-dogs\">hiking</a> boots are considered better than cowboy boots when hunting.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Do cowboy boots have a purpose? Yep!</strong></h2>\n<p>Ever since their <a href=\"https://www.westernbootbarn.com.au/blog/the-history-of-cowboy-boots/\">inception</a>, cowboy boots have been used to ride horses comfortably and keep their riders secure. From their earlier usage as Spanish horse boots in the 1600s to the modern ones we know of, cowboy boots are also now used for ranching and farming.</p>\n<p>But with it also came a style that people simply enjoy wearing, such as in the 40’s, when the pointed-toed cowboy boot became an American icon. So what’s the purpose of a cowboy boot? Just about anything you want it to be!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Are hunting boots necessary? No, not really. </strong></h2>\n<p>Due to how <a href=\"https://decideoutside.com/hiking-boots-vs-hunting-boots/\">safe</a> it is, sticking to the trails in just about any footwear is game. As long as they have <em>some</em> support, like insulating your feet from the cold, then pick any kind of footwear you want!</p>\n<p>Remember that piece of advice earlier, the one about hunting boots having more <a href=\"https://decideoutside.com/hiking-boots-vs-hunting-boots/\">mass</a>? That will add to cost in addition to the extra protection you’ll be getting.</p>\n<p>However, most hunts in general would likely involve some off-terrain traveling. Wearing cowboy boots in the thick muck or woods would get you a sprain sooner than getting your target.</p>\n<p>Let’s not forget about <a href=\"https://dresscodehub.com/wear-cowboy-boots-hunting/\">safety</a>. Harming yourself in the middle of nowhere means you won’t get help for quite a while. Cowboy boots <em>may</em> protect you from a snake bite, but an actual snake boot will do the job better. Use an intended boot for an intended purpose. Can you be a cowboy in the thick wilderness? Not without a horse!</p>\n<p>All in all, you’re your own boss. We’re just discussing what’s best for <em>you</em> in addition to what you prefer.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>Hunting doesn’t always have to be extreme, but with extreme terrain, <a href=\"https://dresscodehub.com/wear-cowboy-boots-hunting/\">hunting</a> boots are best for hunting.</p>\n<p>How long you hunt has a part to play in it too. Perhaps bring another pair of boots with you? Even if your cowboy boots break or can’t get you to where you need to go, then at least you have something extra that you can swap with. Having a variety of tools and tricks will help just about any hunter. Especially when hunting some difficult game.</p>\n<p>Want to go for cowboy boots anyway? By all means! At least you know now that you can make it work, <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/I-live-in-the-Appalachian-region-and-I-hunt-Are-cowgirl-western-boots-good-for-hunting-in-mountains-especially-walking-around-a-lot-trailing-outside-dogs\">somewhat</a>. This isn’t to discourage anyone from trying, but cowboy boots with extra support can make all the difference.</p>\n<p>Regardless of your choices, be prepared for <em>any</em> hunt you decide to go on. Check the weather. Will it be slippery after that storm? Is the area on a steep mountain ridge? Was there a flood on the plains last night? If things get wild, then it’s a good idea to leave any cowboy boots at home.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>You have a pair of cowboy boots that you want to slip on for a long journey on the road, but is doing so a good idea? In this article, we’ll discuss the pros and cons of choosing to get behind the wheel with cowboy boots on your feet.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Can you get into the driver's cabin in cowboy boots? Yes you can!</strong></h2>\n<p>There’s <a href=\"https://www.motorbiscuit.com/illegal-wear-high-heels-while-driving/\">no law</a> in the US saying you <em>can’t</em> drive in boots that have heels on them, so if that’s your wish, then go ahead! However, the positioning of your feet around the pedals might be a bit awkward, so exercise caution before starting up your vehicle.</p>\n<p>One idea you could try is testing your boots to see how they contact the pedals. Of course, make sure your engine is off and the vehicle is in park before you do this. If nothing feels weird or unsafe to you, then it should be safe to drive with cowboy boots on.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Should you drive while wearing cowboy boots? That’s up to you, but consider some tips before hitting the road.</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite no law barring the use of cowboy boots while driving, many driving experts advise <a href=\"https://www.motorbiscuit.com/what-not-wear-driving-car/\">against</a> wearing them when you’re behind the wheel.</p>\n<p>The reason is that certain footwear reduces the ability for your feet to feel the pedals. The thicker the soles, the harder it is to know if your foot is, in fact, on the brake pedal or not.</p>\n<p>Highheels and wedges are the worst for driving. Cowboy boots usually fit into that heel category. The higher the heel on your pair of boots, the riskier it gets.</p>\n<p>However, this doesn’t mean it’s completely unsafe to drive with that slick pair of boots you own. In fact, there are a few <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/can-you-drive-in-cowboy-boots/\">advantages</a> that come with wearing cowboy boots while driving. You can depend on better toe protection than other simpler kinds of footwear, and seeing how <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/how-long-do-cowboy-boots-last/\">durable</a> cowboy boots are, you can expect to drive in that pair for many years to come.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>How do you go driving in cowboy boots? Carefully.</strong></h2>\n<p>Yes, there are some advantages when it comes to cowboy boots and driving, but keep in mind the warnings too.</p>\n<p>For example, even though the toes can protect you from impact damage, constantly applying the break and gas can <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/can-you-drive-in-cowboy-boots/\">wear down</a> your feet and legs in a hurry.</p>\n<p>This applies to narrow toe boxes, so to avoid this issue, pick a pair of boots with more toe room. The last thing you want while riding down the road is to have your feet seize up from cramps and pain.</p>\n<p>For those driving under three hours per trip, issues such as narrow toe boxes and a lack of proper foot support shouldn’t be much of an issue.</p>\n<p>However, for those who will be behind the wheel for hours on end, grab some gel pads in addition to selecting a pair of cowboy boots that will give your toes more space to feel and operate.</p>\n<p>To sum things up, it’s not so much <em>how</em> you drive in boots, it’s <em>what</em> you decide to wear for long trips. Any of the above risks are not guaranteed to happen, but the longer you drive in cowboy boots, the more likely you’ll experience discomfort and pain. Plan ahead before getting in the driver’s seat.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Which shoes are best for driving? Something that’s flat and allows your feet to feel the pedals better.</strong></h2>\n<p>Shoes that are a good bet for driving include <a href=\"https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-driving-shoes\">thin soles</a> that allow the driver to better feel which pedal is which. One of the best soles to look out for is a “pebbled” one, allowing just about any person to feel what’s underneath.</p>\n<p>Some examples of these shoes include loafers, moccasins, and Uggs. Various kinds of sneakers and specialized <a href=\"https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-driving-shoes\">racing boots</a> can work well too.</p>\n<p>However, these kinds of footwear aren’t mandatory, just highly recommended for long periods of driving. Cowboy boots can do the job as well, just as long as you consider the state of your feet and how they behave on long road trips.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Can I pull off cowboy boots? You can with the right outfit.</strong></h2>\n<p>Wearing cowboy boots means you’re making a statement. Whether it’s for style, your cultural background, or simply wanting to try something interesting, people <em>will</em> notice your boots once you step out of the driver’s seat.</p>\n<p>A good piece of advice to consider is selecting a nice pair of <a href=\"https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-driving-shoes\">jeans</a> that can match your cowboy boots. Pairs like boot-cut jeans will match your boots in a stylish way. To achieve a more modern look, pick some jeans in dark blue or even charcoal wash.</p>\n<p>Also, let’s not forget about cowboy boots. If you’re going for appearance, check out this handy <a href=\"https://www.ariat.com/al/cowboy-boot-styles\">style-guide</a> to help you achieve the best look.</p>\n<p>For heavy duty jobs like cargo truck driving and construction, seriously consider getting a pair of <a href=\"https://www.ariat.com/mens-cowboy-boots?sz=24\">work</a> cowboy boots. Remember that bit earlier about toe protection? Most work boots these days have steel toes in them, which will keep your feet safe from harm.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>There’s no one particular way to drive perfectly in cowboy boots. Everyone has different feet and preferences in how long they drive.</p>\n<p>The biggest thing, however, to consider is how <em>comfortable</em> your feet are in cowboy boots. You won’t drive in anything <em>un</em>comfortable, so pick something that will prevent that.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>Yes they do, and quite perfectly we might add. The bottoms of the Levi's 501 jeans are wide enough to fit over your boots without looking ridiculous. It is like the two garments were made specifically for each other. As a point of reference, the same holds true for most other jeans with cowboy boots. The exception is the skinny jeans. Those are meant to be worn on the insides of your boots.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Expanding on this thought!</h2>\n<p><strong>Although it is really a matter of personal preference, we have to say that the Levi's 501 jeans tend to be the favorite. If you are just now shopping for a pair of jeans to go with your authentic cowboy boots, the 501s are the style to choose.</strong></p>\n<p>This is the combination you would wear for everyday use. If you are attending a formal event, then you might want to select a pair of skinny jeans that automatically go on the inside of your boots. Top the outfit off with a stylish cowboy hat, and you will catch the eye of everyone else at the event.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Should I size up for Levi's 501 jeans?</h2>\n<p><strong>You should already know your true jeans size. If it has been a while or this is your first time buying jeans to go with your cowboy boots, then yes, do size them up. You want them to fit correctly. Some so-called fashion experts think you should buy your jeans small, particularly in the waist. We disagree! We say they should be comfortable and a little loose.</strong></p>\n<p>What is more important to you? Looking perfect in your jeans, or being able to walk and sit down in them. What good is owning the perfect pair of jeans if you are not comfortable in them?</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What is the key to selecting jeans to go with your cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>Definitely go with wide-bottomed legs. They will fit properly over your boots and look sensational. When you go to buy your jeans, bring along the boots you intend to wear them with. You want them to hang loosely over the boots. Try on various pairs of jeans until you find one that fits just right.</strong></p>\n<p>What you do not want is the pant legs to be bunched up at the top of your boots. This would look so silly. Does this remind you of someone who has tried that? Didn't he or she look ridiculous? You want a nice tapered look of the jeans over your boots.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Can you wear Levi's 505 jeans with cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>You can try this combination, but don't be surprised if people laugh at you. This is because Levi's 505 are straight-legged jeans. They do not look good tucked into the boots or draped over the outsides of them.</strong></p>\n<p>What happens is every crease of the boots will show underneath the jeans. Not only that, but the tops of your boots will make the jeans stick out at the point of contact. This style of jeans is really not meant to go with cowboy boots.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What jeans work with cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>As we have been discussing, there are many brands and styles of jeans that go splendidly with cowboy boots. There are two ways you can go. One is to wear your jeans with the pant legs hanging loosely over the boots. This is always acceptable. </strong></p>\n<p>The other way is to wear skinny jeans which are automatically tucked into the cowboy boots. If you are wearing a pair of boots that are marvelously crafted and you wish to show them off, skinny jeans will do the trick.</p>\n<p>Your jeans don't have to be Levi's either. There are a number of makers and individual styles you can choose to wear. Always remember to try them on before buying them. The right pair is out there for you.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What is the fit of Levi's 501 jeans?</h2>\n<p><strong>Some jeans makers use a stretchy denim, however, most Levi's 501 jeans are created with 100% cotton. They tend to sit tightly around the waist with straight legs and roomy at the thighs. </strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What about Levi's 501-type jeans for women and for kids?</h2>\n<p><strong>Yes, there are such things. They are called Levi's 501 Jeans for Women. There are also Levi's for kids with different style names. All of these varieties of Levi's jeans are designed to be worn with cowboy boots. Unless they are the skinny jeans, they should all hang down over your boots. </strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p><strong>The most important thing to take away from this article is yes, Levi's 501 jeans can be worn with cowboy boots. This is true of all genders and all age groups. We have even provided advice on how to properly wear this combination. You are all set now!</strong></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>There are a few smells that can emanate from your cowboy boots. One is the smell of brand-new leather when you first bring home your new boots. Another one is foot odor. This happens after you have been wearing your boots for a while and your feet were hot and sweaty. The last one is a musty smell. A combination of factors can contribute to that smell. Want to know more? Keep reading this article. </strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Do cowboy boots make your feet stink?</h2>\n<p><strong>It is more like the other way around. Smelly, sweaty feet will make your cowboy boots stink. </strong>No matter how comfortable your boots are, long periods of wear will make your feet hot and sweaty. This is especially true if you do not wear socks with them. After a while the odor accumulates inside your boots and presto, you have stinky cowboy boots.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>How can you make your cowboy boots not smell?</h2>\n<p><strong>Making sure your feet do not smell when you wear the boots can mitigate the smell coming from them. You can also use products made to make your feet not smell such as odor eaters.</strong></p>\n<p>Once the smell does permeate your boots, you can sprinkle some baking soda on the insides. Then let the boots sit overnight. Better yet, put your boots outside in the fresh air overnight. The combination of the fresh air and the baking soda should eliminate the horrible odor from the boots.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Ways to prevent your cowboy boots from smelling</h2>\n<p><strong>Keeping in mind it is not possible to completely prevent your boots from smelling, we will list some factors that should at least lessen the odor emanating from them. They are as follows:</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend a little money on them when you buy them, do not go with the cheapest boots</li>\n<li>Keep your feet, legs, and body clean</li>\n<li>Make sure you are always wearing clean socks</li>\n<li>Avoid cotton socks altogether</li>\n<li>Do not wear the same pair of boots all the time</li>\n<li>Keep your boots in a well-ventilated place</li>\n<li>Be proactive with the baking soda, sprinkle it inside the boots BEFORE they start to smell</li>\n<li>Leave them outside in the fresh air periodically</li>\n<li>Try to avoid letting your boots get soaking wet too often</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Other options for getting rid of the odor from your cowboy boots</h2>\n<p><strong>Take a little bit of white vinegar and mix it with water inside a spray bottle. The vinegar not only will neutralize the smell, but will kill any bacteria as well. Take this mixture and spray the inside of your boots after each use. Then allow them to dry for a period of time.</strong></p>\n<p>If you do not like this idea, you can stick to the baking soda method. But know that this mixture of vinegar and water will work just as well. As we just said, there is good old-fashioned plain fresh air. Leaving your boots outside for a while will also work wonders. Any of these methods should do the trick.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What factors can contribute to smelly cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>We have been discussing that. In the first place, repeated use of the boots will see a build-up of sweat from your feet. If you like to wear the same socks more than one day, the smell inside your socks will also accumulate. Ultimately that will make your boots smell.</strong></p>\n<p>On the other hand, you did not buy your cowboy boots to have them sit in your closet forever. You bought them to wear. No matter how many pairs you have, or what precautions you take, eventually your boots will start to smell. Following our advice will help you out.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Is it okay to wear cowboy boots without socks?</h2>\n<p><strong>Sure, if that is what you want to do, be our guest. Just remember that there won't be any barrier between your hot, sweaty feet and your boots. Socks are that barrier. If you choose not to wear them, expect your cowboy boots to start smelling pretty quickly.</strong></p>\n<p>Wearing boots without socks can also be rather uncomfortable. Think about it! Your bare feet rubbing against the often hard interior lining of your shoes or boots! How uncomfortable will that be? You can choose not to wear the socks, but be ready for the consequences.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p><strong>Of course the idea of stinky cowboy boots is an unpleasant one. But there are solutions for this. Foot odor should not come between you and your boots. You bought the boots because you loved them and want to wear them. Go right ahead and do that. Foot odor is not the end of the world. Men, women, children - enjoy wearing your western boots!</strong></p>",

Be sure to try them on before you buy them to be sure they are comfortable.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Who makes cowboy boots suitable for hiking?</h2>\n<p><strong>Most of the major boot manufacturers now include at least one pair. Names like Ariat, Tecovas, and Lucchese amongst many others.

There is no rule that says all your boots must come from the same source. You can own as many pairs of cowboy boots as you want.</strong></p>\n<p>You can also try getting in touch with your preferred maker and suggesting it. Many companies thrive on customer suggestions. Who knows, maybe they will listen to you. Meanwhile, you have plenty of other brands to select from. Enjoy your boots!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>For all intensive purposes, your cowboy boots really should match your hat. One thing you can do is purchase your boots specifically to match your hat. Bring your hat along with you when you visit the boot store.</strong> Then you can be sure they will go together perfectly. Will you be arrested if they do not match? No, of course not. This is merely a fashion suggestion. Let us explore this topic.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Can you wear a cowboy hat without cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>Technically doing this is a fashion faux pas. Style experts say wearing sneakers or ordinary shoes with a cowboy hat is not good. </strong>According to them, wearing them with anything other than cowboy boots looks silly.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that, along with the boots, the rest of your outfit should be the same style. Wear an appropriate shirt and pants with your cowboy hat and boots. Otherwise, why bother to add just the boots? What will happen to you if you ignore this advice? Absolutely nothing!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Is it considered disrespectful to wear a cowboy hat?</h2>\n<p><strong>In theory, if you are not a cowboy and have never even been on a horse, the answer is yes.</strong> In this case, it is disrespectful to the folks that do this. However, this is 2022 and things have changed. Nowadays, many people wear cowboy hats and boots who truthfully should not.</p>\n<p>Word to the wise though. If you are dressed like this and stroll into a cowboy bar, be prepared to face some guff. There are some people who will take offense to this. If you do not care about this, go ahead and wear the cowboy hat and boots!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>How to match your cowboy hat to the boots</h2>\n<p><strong>Let's take the color black which is the most versatile one. It is nearly impossible to find a hat and boots that are exactly the same shade of black. What you want to do is come as close as possible. This holds true of your belt too. Ideally you ought to select a hat, boots, and a belt that are the same basic colors.</strong></p>\n<p>The rest of your outfit should be a contrasting color. You really do not want to wear attire that is all the same color. What you can do is keep these style guidelines in mind when you are purchasing the pieces to your outfit. Trust us, you will look very dashing.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What about women wearing a hat with cowgirl boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>The same fashion rules are true for the ladies. A woman should wear similarly colored boots with her hat. If she wears a belt, that ought to match up as well. </strong></p>\n<p>Some people will tell you not to wear fringe, sequins, or rhinestone outfits with your hat and boots. We take the opposite view. If you have ever observed participants in a western-themed parade, you will see this all the time. They look smashingly great doing so. Go ahead and wear them!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What is the cowboy hat rule?</h2>\n<p><strong>We have been discussing this throughout our blog. </strong>The rule actually is, if you are not an authentic cowboy or cowgirl, you should not be wearing such attire. There are people who will be offended by it and could act aggressively towards those who violate this rule.</p>\n<p>The flip side is, rules are meant to be broken. New fashion trends are always emerging. If you decide you want to wear a cowboy hat and matching boots, who is going to stop you? You might be part of the newest fashion revolution and inspire others to follow suit.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What color should my cowboy hat be?</h2>\n<p><strong>It can be any color you choose. If you love cowboy hats, why stop at one? You can own several of them, each a different color. </strong>Then have a pair of boots that go with each hat. The rest of your attire looks best if the colors compliment that hat and boots.</p>\n<p>There are certain colors associated with special occasions. For example, a black cowboy hat with finely-stitched black western boots is appropriate to wear to dressy events. It is best if you find out the rules of etiquette when wearing the hat.
