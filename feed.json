In order to prevent this from happenind, you'll have to wear very long socks that go all the way up to your knees, and give the boots ample time to break in. </strong></p>\n<p>Over the course of several wearing sessions, you should start to notice that your boots will start to become a lot more comfortable and tolerable as you walk around.</p>\n<p>Speaking of breaking in cowboy boots, let's take a quick look at how to do that really fast so you can stop them from rubbing against your leg!</p>\n<h2>How do you break in cowboy boots fast?</h2>\n<p>Let's talk about how to break in cowboy boots fast and effectively. <strong>The simple solution is frankly to start wearing them all over the place. Wearing cowboy boots is the most natural way of letting them quickly form to the size of your feet and calves. </strong></p>\n<p>The leather material that cowboy boots are made from is initially quite stiff, but over time it becomes soft and maleable. This means that as you make it a habit of just wearing them all around town, they will very quickly start to loosen up quite a bit </p>\n<p>Having cowboy boots loosen up on you will feel great, and certainly protect your legs from the constant irritation of having the leather hit your extremeties.</p>\n<p>Now that we've briefly covered how you can quickly break in your boots to properly adjust to your leg, let's take a quick look as to why your boots may be hard to fit into intitially. </p>\n<h2>Why do some cowboy boots rub against your leg?</h2>\n<p>If you're wondering why some cowboy boots may be rubbing against your leg, the reasoning is quite simple. I<strong>t's just that as you purchase a new pair, they are essentially made of a stiff type of leather that takes a lot of conditioning by wearing them around all over.</strong></p>\n<p>This means that the leather is very hard to fit even your feet into them at least at first glance, but over time the leather will start to obtain moisture and overall wear to them that will make them very easy to stretch.</p>\n<p>Speaking of stretching you boots out, let's answer the qeustion as to how you can go about doing so.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exacc_9BYRYsz-Or23qtsP_t2MgA83\" class=\"iDjcJe IX9Lgd wwB5gf\">How can I stretch the calf of my cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>In order to properly break in and stretch out the calf of your cowboy boots, simply try wearing them everywhere you go.</strong> This may seem obvious, but is the most natural way of letting them properly form to your particular size and shape of legs and feet. </p>\n<p>There are probably some aftermarket and manual ways of trying to stretch out the leather of your boots, but you run the risk of either over stretching or even ripping your boots apart.</p>\n<p>Always go the natural route!</p>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>If you're tired of having your cowboy boots rubbing against your leg, then have no fear.</p>\n<p><strong>One of the most simple fixes to this issue is simply just wear them practically everywhere you go. This is the most natural and efficient way of letting them form to your individual profile.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

The reasoning behind this is simply that the shaft will start to irritate your skin as soon as you try and wear a pair of boots without any socks.

You don't want that.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">When wearing boots, you want it to be as comfortable as possible. Also ask yourself the question, why would you honestly even consider wearing a pair of boots without any socks? This will just further ruin the experience.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Not to mention, when you start walking around, you may begin to sweat quite a bit and make the leather stink.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:separator --></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><!-- /wp:separator -->\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"textAlign\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Are you supposed to wear socks with boots?</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>You are always supposed to wear socks with boots. Not only are you supposed to be wearing socks, they should be long socks that go all the way up past your calve. That's simply because of the elongated shaft of many boots that people wear. </strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">You can find boot styled socks anywhere that sells cowboy boots. Usually, it is relatively thick material that is able to withstand a lot of friction from the shaft part of the boot.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:separator --></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><!-- /wp:separator -->\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"textAlign\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Thick or thin socks with cowboy boots</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>If you're trying to decide on thick or thin socks to wear with your cowboy boots, always try to go for the thicker cut of socks. They're usually more durable and can retain heat better if you happen to be wearing it out in the cold. There's really no downside for thick cut socks. </strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Thin socks on the other hand, are frankly a lot harder to be higher quality. They don't last as long, and if you happen to be out in the elements, then you will certainly be more exposed.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"textAlign\":\"center\",\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-theme-palette-1-color\">Quality of the sock</span></h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>The quality of your boot socks matter. That's because they need to withstand the constant friction of rubbing against the elongated shaft of the boot. Not only that, but just in general, thicker material will just last longer. There's more room for the fabric to start degrading. </strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">When you just have a thin little piece of fabric that you call a sock, once it starts eroding away - you're not left with a whole lot.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Whenever you're in the store, just grab a nice, thick pair of boot styled socks to save yourself a lot of headache down the road.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:separator --></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><!-- /wp:separator -->\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"textAlign\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Best socks to wear with cowboy boots</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">The best socks to wear with cowboy boots are ones that are very comfortable, thick in quality, and match the coloring of your boots specifically.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Whenever you’re out shopping for some socks to wear with your cowboy boots, make sure to always grab quality material. This is the most critical part of buying socks that can withstand the coarse nature of the leather shaft of the boot. Having thick and great quality socks to wear with your boots allows for a longer shelflife. </strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Like with most things, you don’t want to always have to buy a lot of different clothes just for the sake of buying clothes. You want to think of buying your socks as an investment and not a cost. </p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Even though they’re thicker quality and are probably a lot more expensive than thinner types of socks, rest assured that you will hardly ever need to buy socks again for your boots.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">If you’re into style and want to present yourself in an excellent way, consider getting boot socks that match the leather coloring of your boots. </p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Even though for the most part, you will never be able to see them because of the long shaft of the boot, it still looks really cool if you ever happened to roll your jeans or pants up to where others can see the coloring of your socks. Having matching clothes is always a plus.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:separator --></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"><!-- /wp:separator -->\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"textAlign\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Socks that stay up in boots</h2>\n<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Finally, you’ll want to not only get socks that look cool and that are of high-quality, but you will also want to obtain socks that are relatively comfortable. For the most part, boots are not that comfortable of shoes to be walking around in to begin with. Not to mention having to get very thick socks that roll all the way up to your knees. </strong></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Great way to make this a little bit more enjoyable and pleasurable, is to get socks that have plenty of cushioning and her overall very comfortable to wear.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">You don’t want socks that are uncomfortable and are always falling down, so just make sure to grab some very high-quality thick, and comfortable types of socks to wear with your cowboy boots.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Another thing to consider when you’re deciding on whether or not to wear socks while wearing boots, is to grab some socks that fit you well enough. That means get socks that are somewhat tight but not too uncomfortable. </p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">This will just help the socks stay in place and ensure that you never have to you always roll up your pants and reapply the socks back up to your knees. I’ve done that many times and it’s frankly very annoying.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>",
