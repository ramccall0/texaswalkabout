            "content_html": "<p>Hunting season is approaching. You want to be prepared. You have your weapons, your schedule, food and supplies all ready to go. Yet, what about those pair of cowboy boots in your closet? They’re quite reliable and stylish, but will they be tough enough for the hunts ahead? In this article, we’ll discuss whether you should or shouldn’t wear them while hunting, and what you can do to protect your feet from just about any hunting activity.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Are cowboy boots good for hunting? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>No, not really.</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, cowboy boots won’t serve you well in the wilderness when hunting game. This is due to their <a href=\"https://dresscodehub.com/wear-cowboy-boots-hunting/\">intended design</a>, which does not include protecting your feet from long hunts.</p>\n<p>The two major disadvantages cowboy boots have are their lack of grip on the outer soles and poor ankle support. This can be especially problematic if you choose to hunt off the beaten trail.</p>\n<p>Heavily wooded areas or desert can become incredibly slippery during or after a rain. Cowboy boots won’t help you with this, they’re simply not designed for any of that.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Should you wear cowboy boots while hunting? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>You can, but it’s generally not a good idea.</strong></p>\n<p>Even though there are various hunting <a href=\"https://dsgouterwear.com/blog/blaze-orange-hunting-requirements-by-state-usa/\">rules</a> in the US that all hunters must abide by, there’s virtually nothing saying you can’t wear cowboy boots on a hunt if you want to. Therefore, it’s your choice.</p>\n<p>Some people have recommended using <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/I-live-in-the-Appalachian-region-and-I-hunt-Are-cowgirl-western-boots-good-for-hunting-in-mountains-especially-walking-around-a-lot-trailing-outside-dogs\">roper-style</a> cowboy boots over traditional ones, due to their <a href=\"https://www.westernbootbarn.com.au/blog/the-history-of-cowboy-boots/\">lower</a> heel heights. Just in case, make sure any ropers you’re interested in also come with good grip.</p>\n<p>The primary subject here, however, is that it’s a better idea to wear boots for their intended <a href=\"https://www.idahostatejournal.com/outdoors/xtreme_idaho/yes-you-do-need-different-boots-for-different-activities/article_08fe4796-8969-5b24-bd43-35fbe20bd88f.html\">purposes</a>. Going for a hike? Hiking boots. Going on a hunt? Hunting boots, especially for colder weather.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the choice is yours, but don’t ignore your safety, either. You might be out in the wild for several hours on end. At the very least, cowboy boots can <em>technically</em> work if you walk on open trails, places that aren’t usually affected all too much by weather. Use careful judgement.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What boots do you wear for hunting? Boots for hunting. </strong></h2>\n<p>Hunting boots are used for hunting. Many are <a href=\"https://protips.dickssportinggoods.com/sports-and-activities/hunt-and-fish/learn-about-different-types-of-hunting-boots\">specially</a> designed for colder weather, have cleats in addition to heavy rubber grip, high ankles to protect the legs from bites and sharp brush, and insulating layers for sitting still on long winter hunts.</p>\n<p>However, be warned, they have a little extra <a href=\"https://decideoutside.com/hiking-boots-vs-hunting-boots/\">mass</a> than most outdoor shoes and boots. That’s right, <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/I-live-in-the-Appalachian-region-and-I-hunt-Are-cowgirl-western-boots-good-for-hunting-in-mountains-especially-walking-around-a-lot-trailing-outside-dogs\">hiking</a> boots are considered better than cowboy boots when hunting.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Do cowboy boots have a purpose? Yep!</strong></h2>\n<p>Ever since their <a href=\"https://www.westernbootbarn.com.au/blog/the-history-of-cowboy-boots/\">inception</a>, cowboy boots have been used to ride horses comfortably and keep their riders secure. From their earlier usage as Spanish horse boots in the 1600s to the modern ones we know of, cowboy boots are also now used for ranching and farming.</p>\n<p>But with it also came a style that people simply enjoy wearing, such as in the 40’s, when the pointed-toed cowboy boot became an American icon. So what’s the purpose of a cowboy boot? Just about anything you want it to be!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Are hunting boots necessary? No, not really. </strong></h2>\n<p>Due to how <a href=\"https://decideoutside.com/hiking-boots-vs-hunting-boots/\">safe</a> it is, sticking to the trails in just about any footwear is game. As long as they have <em>some</em> support, like insulating your feet from the cold, then pick any kind of footwear you want!</p>\n<p>Remember that piece of advice earlier, the one about hunting boots having more <a href=\"https://decideoutside.com/hiking-boots-vs-hunting-boots/\">mass</a>? That will add to cost in addition to the extra protection you’ll be getting.</p>\n<p>However, most hunts in general would likely involve some off-terrain traveling. Wearing cowboy boots in the thick muck or woods would get you a sprain sooner than getting your target.</p>\n<p>Let’s not forget about <a href=\"https://dresscodehub.com/wear-cowboy-boots-hunting/\">safety</a>. Harming yourself in the middle of nowhere means you won’t get help for quite a while. Cowboy boots <em>may</em> protect you from a snake bite, but an actual snake boot will do the job better. Use an intended boot for an intended purpose. Can you be a cowboy in the thick wilderness? Not without a horse!</p>\n<p>All in all, you’re your own boss. We’re just discussing what’s best for <em>you</em> in addition to what you prefer.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>Hunting doesn’t always have to be extreme, but with extreme terrain, <a href=\"https://dresscodehub.com/wear-cowboy-boots-hunting/\">hunting</a> boots are best for hunting.</p>\n<p>How long you hunt has a part to play in it too. Perhaps bring another pair of boots with you? Even if your cowboy boots break or can’t get you to where you need to go, then at least you have something extra that you can swap with. Having a variety of tools and tricks will help just about any hunter. Especially when hunting some difficult game.</p>\n<p>Want to go for cowboy boots anyway? By all means! At least you know now that you can make it work, <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/I-live-in-the-Appalachian-region-and-I-hunt-Are-cowgirl-western-boots-good-for-hunting-in-mountains-especially-walking-around-a-lot-trailing-outside-dogs\">somewhat</a>. This isn’t to discourage anyone from trying, but cowboy boots with extra support can make all the difference.</p>\n<p>Regardless of your choices, be prepared for <em>any</em> hunt you decide to go on. Check the weather. Will it be slippery after that storm? Is the area on a steep mountain ridge? Was there a flood on the plains last night? If things get wild, then it’s a good idea to leave any cowboy boots at home.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>You have a pair of cowboy boots that you want to slip on for a long journey on the road, but is doing so a good idea? In this article, we’ll discuss the pros and cons of choosing to get behind the wheel with cowboy boots on your feet.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Can you get into the driver's cabin in cowboy boots? Yes you can!</strong></h2>\n<p>There’s <a href=\"https://www.motorbiscuit.com/illegal-wear-high-heels-while-driving/\">no law</a> in the US saying you <em>can’t</em> drive in boots that have heels on them, so if that’s your wish, then go ahead! However, the positioning of your feet around the pedals might be a bit awkward, so exercise caution before starting up your vehicle.</p>\n<p>One idea you could try is testing your boots to see how they contact the pedals. Of course, make sure your engine is off and the vehicle is in park before you do this. If nothing feels weird or unsafe to you, then it should be safe to drive with cowboy boots on.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Should you drive while wearing cowboy boots? That’s up to you, but consider some tips before hitting the road.</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite no law barring the use of cowboy boots while driving, many driving experts advise <a href=\"https://www.motorbiscuit.com/what-not-wear-driving-car/\">against</a> wearing them when you’re behind the wheel.</p>\n<p>The reason is that certain footwear reduces the ability for your feet to feel the pedals. The thicker the soles, the harder it is to know if your foot is, in fact, on the brake pedal or not.</p>\n<p>Highheels and wedges are the worst for driving. Cowboy boots usually fit into that heel category. The higher the heel on your pair of boots, the riskier it gets.</p>\n<p>However, this doesn’t mean it’s completely unsafe to drive with that slick pair of boots you own. In fact, there are a few <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/can-you-drive-in-cowboy-boots/\">advantages</a> that come with wearing cowboy boots while driving. You can depend on better toe protection than other simpler kinds of footwear, and seeing how <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/how-long-do-cowboy-boots-last/\">durable</a> cowboy boots are, you can expect to drive in that pair for many years to come.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>How do you go driving in cowboy boots? Carefully.</strong></h2>\n<p>Yes, there are some advantages when it comes to cowboy boots and driving, but keep in mind the warnings too.</p>\n<p>For example, even though the toes can protect you from impact damage, constantly applying the break and gas can <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/can-you-drive-in-cowboy-boots/\">wear down</a> your feet and legs in a hurry.</p>\n<p>This applies to narrow toe boxes, so to avoid this issue, pick a pair of boots with more toe room. The last thing you want while riding down the road is to have your feet seize up from cramps and pain.</p>\n<p>For those driving under three hours per trip, issues such as narrow toe boxes and a lack of proper foot support shouldn’t be much of an issue.</p>\n<p>However, for those who will be behind the wheel for hours on end, grab some gel pads in addition to selecting a pair of cowboy boots that will give your toes more space to feel and operate.</p>\n<p>To sum things up, it’s not so much <em>how</em> you drive in boots, it’s <em>what</em> you decide to wear for long trips. Any of the above risks are not guaranteed to happen, but the longer you drive in cowboy boots, the more likely you’ll experience discomfort and pain. Plan ahead before getting in the driver’s seat.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Which shoes are best for driving? Something that’s flat and allows your feet to feel the pedals better.</strong></h2>\n<p>Shoes that are a good bet for driving include <a href=\"https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-driving-shoes\">thin soles</a> that allow the driver to better feel which pedal is which. One of the best soles to look out for is a “pebbled” one, allowing just about any person to feel what’s underneath.</p>\n<p>Some examples of these shoes include loafers, moccasins, and Uggs. Various kinds of sneakers and specialized <a href=\"https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-driving-shoes\">racing boots</a> can work well too.</p>\n<p>However, these kinds of footwear aren’t mandatory, just highly recommended for long periods of driving. Cowboy boots can do the job as well, just as long as you consider the state of your feet and how they behave on long road trips.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Can I pull off cowboy boots? You can with the right outfit.</strong></h2>\n<p>Wearing cowboy boots means you’re making a statement. Whether it’s for style, your cultural background, or simply wanting to try something interesting, people <em>will</em> notice your boots once you step out of the driver’s seat.</p>\n<p>A good piece of advice to consider is selecting a nice pair of <a href=\"https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-driving-shoes\">jeans</a> that can match your cowboy boots. Pairs like boot-cut jeans will match your boots in a stylish way. To achieve a more modern look, pick some jeans in dark blue or even charcoal wash.</p>\n<p>Also, let’s not forget about cowboy boots. If you’re going for appearance, check out this handy <a href=\"https://www.ariat.com/al/cowboy-boot-styles\">style-guide</a> to help you achieve the best look.</p>\n<p>For heavy duty jobs like cargo truck driving and construction, seriously consider getting a pair of <a href=\"https://www.ariat.com/mens-cowboy-boots?sz=24\">work</a> cowboy boots. Remember that bit earlier about toe protection? Most work boots these days have steel toes in them, which will keep your feet safe from harm.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>There’s no one particular way to drive perfectly in cowboy boots. Everyone has different feet and preferences in how long they drive.</p>\n<p>The biggest thing, however, to consider is how <em>comfortable</em> your feet are in cowboy boots. You won’t drive in anything <em>un</em>comfortable, so pick something that will prevent that.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>Yes they do, and quite perfectly we might add. The bottoms of the Levi's 501 jeans are wide enough to fit over your boots without looking ridiculous. It is like the two garments were made specifically for each other. As a point of reference, the same holds true for most other jeans with cowboy boots. The exception is the skinny jeans. Those are meant to be worn on the insides of your boots.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Expanding on this thought!</h2>\n<p><strong>Although it is really a matter of personal preference, we have to say that the Levi's 501 jeans tend to be the favorite. If you are just now shopping for a pair of jeans to go with your authentic cowboy boots, the 501s are the style to choose.</strong></p>\n<p>This is the combination you would wear for everyday use. If you are attending a formal event, then you might want to select a pair of skinny jeans that automatically go on the inside of your boots. Top the outfit off with a stylish cowboy hat, and you will catch the eye of everyone else at the event.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Should I size up for Levi's 501 jeans?</h2>\n<p><strong>You should already know your true jeans size. If it has been a while or this is your first time buying jeans to go with your cowboy boots, then yes, do size them up. You want them to fit correctly. Some so-called fashion experts think you should buy your jeans small, particularly in the waist. We disagree! We say they should be comfortable and a little loose.</strong></p>\n<p>What is more important to you? Looking perfect in your jeans, or being able to walk and sit down in them. What good is owning the perfect pair of jeans if you are not comfortable in them?</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What is the key to selecting jeans to go with your cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>Definitely go with wide-bottomed legs. They will fit properly over your boots and look sensational. When you go to buy your jeans, bring along the boots you intend to wear them with. You want them to hang loosely over the boots. Try on various pairs of jeans until you find one that fits just right.</strong></p>\n<p>What you do not want is the pant legs to be bunched up at the top of your boots. This would look so silly. Does this remind you of someone who has tried that? Didn't he or she look ridiculous? You want a nice tapered look of the jeans over your boots.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Can you wear Levi's 505 jeans with cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>You can try this combination, but don't be surprised if people laugh at you. This is because Levi's 505 are straight-legged jeans. They do not look good tucked into the boots or draped over the outsides of them.</strong></p>\n<p>What happens is every crease of the boots will show underneath the jeans. Not only that, but the tops of your boots will make the jeans stick out at the point of contact. This style of jeans is really not meant to go with cowboy boots.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What jeans work with cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>As we have been discussing, there are many brands and styles of jeans that go splendidly with cowboy boots. There are two ways you can go. One is to wear your jeans with the pant legs hanging loosely over the boots. This is always acceptable. </strong></p>\n<p>The other way is to wear skinny jeans which are automatically tucked into the cowboy boots. If you are wearing a pair of boots that are marvelously crafted and you wish to show them off, skinny jeans will do the trick.</p>\n<p>Your jeans don't have to be Levi's either. There are a number of makers and individual styles you can choose to wear. Always remember to try them on before buying them. The right pair is out there for you.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What is the fit of Levi's 501 jeans?</h2>\n<p><strong>Some jeans makers use a stretchy denim, however, most Levi's 501 jeans are created with 100% cotton. They tend to sit tightly around the waist with straight legs and roomy at the thighs. </strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What about Levi's 501-type jeans for women and for kids?</h2>\n<p><strong>Yes, there are such things. They are called Levi's 501 Jeans for Women. There are also Levi's for kids with different style names. All of these varieties of Levi's jeans are designed to be worn with cowboy boots. Unless they are the skinny jeans, they should all hang down over your boots. </strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p><strong>The most important thing to take away from this article is yes, Levi's 501 jeans can be worn with cowboy boots. This is true of all genders and all age groups. We have even provided advice on how to properly wear this combination. You are all set now!</strong></p>",

Another one is foot odor. This happens after you have been wearing your boots for a while and your feet were hot and sweaty. The last one is a musty smell. A combination of factors can contribute to that smell. Want to know more? Keep reading this article. </strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Do cowboy boots make your feet stink?</h2>\n<p><strong>It is more like the other way around. Smelly, sweaty feet will make your cowboy boots stink. </strong>No matter how comfortable your boots are, long periods of wear will make your feet hot and sweaty. This is especially true if you do not wear socks with them. After a while the odor accumulates inside your boots and presto, you have stinky cowboy boots.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>How can you make your cowboy boots not smell?</h2>\n<p><strong>Making sure your feet do not smell when you wear the boots can mitigate the smell coming from them. You can also use products made to make your feet not smell such as odor eaters.</strong></p>\n<p>Once the smell does permeate your boots, you can sprinkle some baking soda on the insides. Then let the boots sit overnight. Better yet, put your boots outside in the fresh air overnight. The combination of the fresh air and the baking soda should eliminate the horrible odor from the boots.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Ways to prevent your cowboy boots from smelling</h2>\n<p><strong>Keeping in mind it is not possible to completely prevent your boots from smelling, we will list some factors that should at least lessen the odor emanating from them. They are as follows:</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spend a little money on them when you buy them, do not go with the cheapest boots</li>\n<li>Keep your feet, legs, and body clean</li>\n<li>Make sure you are always wearing clean socks</li>\n<li>Avoid cotton socks altogether</li>\n<li>Do not wear the same pair of boots all the time</li>\n<li>Keep your boots in a well-ventilated place</li>\n<li>Be proactive with the baking soda, sprinkle it inside the boots BEFORE they start to smell</li>\n<li>Leave them outside in the fresh air periodically</li>\n<li>Try to avoid letting your boots get soaking wet too often</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Other options for getting rid of the odor from your cowboy boots</h2>\n<p><strong>Take a little bit of white vinegar and mix it with water inside a spray bottle. The vinegar not only will neutralize the smell, but will kill any bacteria as well. Take this mixture and spray the inside of your boots after each use. Then allow them to dry for a period of time.</strong></p>\n<p>If you do not like this idea, you can stick to the baking soda method. But know that this mixture of vinegar and water will work just as well. As we just said, there is good old-fashioned plain fresh air. Leaving your boots outside for a while will also work wonders. Any of these methods should do the trick.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What factors can contribute to smelly cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>We have been discussing that. In the first place, repeated use of the boots will see a build-up of sweat from your feet. If you like to wear the same socks more than one day, the smell inside your socks will also accumulate. Ultimately that will make your boots smell.</strong></p>\n<p>On the other hand, you did not buy your cowboy boots to have them sit in your closet forever. You bought them to wear. No matter how many pairs you have, or what precautions you take, eventually your boots will start to smell. Following our advice will help you out.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Is it okay to wear cowboy boots without socks?</h2>\n<p><strong>Sure, if that is what you want to do, be our guest. Just remember that there won't be any barrier between your hot, sweaty feet and your boots. Socks are that barrier. If you choose not to wear them, expect your cowboy boots to start smelling pretty quickly.</strong></p>\n<p>Wearing boots without socks can also be rather uncomfortable. Think about it! Your bare feet rubbing against the often hard interior lining of your shoes or boots! How uncomfortable will that be? You can choose not to wear the socks, but be ready for the consequences.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p><strong>Of course the idea of stinky cowboy boots is an unpleasant one. But there are solutions for this. Foot odor should not come between you and your boots. You bought the boots because you loved them and want to wear them. Go right ahead and do that. Foot odor is not the end of the world. Men, women, children - enjoy wearing your western boots!</strong></p>",

Be sure to try them on before you buy them to be sure they are comfortable.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Who makes cowboy boots suitable for hiking?</h2>\n<p><strong>Most of the major boot manufacturers now include at least one pair. Names like Ariat, Tecovas, and Lucchese amongst many others. To get an idea of them it is possible to search online, for example the source where you found this article.</strong></p>\n<p>What you can do is go into any western boot store and tell the sales associate you want boots that you can hike in as well as look great. He or she ought to be able to help you find the perfect pair. Boots like these should also be good to work in. Keep these needs in mind when you are selecting them. As we said, definitely try them on before buying.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Make sure they are durable and strong!</h2>\n<p><strong>The old saying you get what you pay for rings true here. When looking for cowboy boots to hike and/or work in, be sure they are from a reliable source. You do not want a boot that cannot stand up to the punishment they will undergo. You want a sturdy, hearty boot that will last a long time. </strong></p>\n<p>Ask pertinent questions of the sales associate. You want boots that are tough and built for rugged terrain. Additionally, you want them to be water-resistant in the event you wear them in wet weather. Does this kind of cowboy boot actually exist? Yes, it does. You just need to take the time to shop for them.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>How far can you walk in cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>If you buy the kind of cowboy boot designed for hiking, you will be able to walk pretty far. </strong>Keep in mind, no matter what type of shoes or boots you wear, after a while your feet will get tired and possibly smelly. That is just the nature of footwear and extended use.</p>\n<p>One important tip is to steer clear of boots with pointy toes and slippery soles. Keep those for your dressier outings. Ideally, it is good to own several pairs of boots. You want some for hiking and working and others to show off how stylish you can be. The sales associate can usually help you select the right pair.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Are cowboy boots comfortable to walk in?</h2>\n<p><strong>In order to be able to walk comfortably in cowboy boots, you want to look at types such as stockmen, ropers, and western work boots. They feature wider toes and heels designed for balancing on rough terrain as well as sand and slippery surfaces.</strong></p>\n<p>We must note that most of the major brands of cowboy boots have at least one model that fits this description. If you have a favorite brand, ask the salesperson to show you suitable models. They will know precisely which boots will accommodate your needs.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What about western boots for women and children?</h2>\n<p><strong>The same availability should apply to boots for women and children. Boot makers that cater to men who want to use them for hiking will most likely have models for them too. They need not give up style in order to get practicality.</strong></p>\n<p>With the ever-increasing popularity of boots amongst the masses of people, the makers have created the perfect boot for every purpose. That trend is certain to continue as folks are snapping up western boots of all kinds.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p><strong>If your preferred boot maker does not have a style that is good for hiking or working, try a different maker. There is no rule that says all your boots must come from the same source. You can own as many pairs of cowboy boots as you want.</strong></p>\n<p>You can also try getting in touch with your preferred maker and suggesting it. Many companies thrive on customer suggestions. Who knows, maybe they will listen to you. Meanwhile, you have plenty of other brands to select from. Enjoy your boots!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>For all intensive purposes, your cowboy boots really should match your hat. One thing you can do is purchase your boots specifically to match your hat. Bring your hat along with you when you visit the boot store.</strong> Then you can be sure they will go together perfectly. Will you be arrested if they do not match? No, of course not. This is merely a fashion suggestion. Let us explore this topic.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Can you wear a cowboy hat without cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>Technically doing this is a fashion faux pas. Style experts say wearing sneakers or ordinary shoes with a cowboy hat is not good. </strong>According to them, wearing them with anything other than cowboy boots looks silly.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that, along with the boots, the rest of your outfit should be the same style. Wear an appropriate shirt and pants with your cowboy hat and boots. Otherwise, why bother to add just the boots? What will happen to you if you ignore this advice? Absolutely nothing!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Is it considered disrespectful to wear a cowboy hat?</h2>\n<p><strong>In theory, if you are not a cowboy and have never even been on a horse, the answer is yes.</strong> In this case, it is disrespectful to the folks that do this. However, this is 2022 and things have changed. Nowadays, many people wear cowboy hats and boots who truthfully should not.</p>\n<p>Word to the wise though. If you are dressed like this and stroll into a cowboy bar, be prepared to face some guff. There are some people who will take offense to this. If you do not care about this, go ahead and wear the cowboy hat and boots!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>How to match your cowboy hat to the boots</h2>\n<p><strong>Let's take the color black which is the most versatile one. It is nearly impossible to find a hat and boots that are exactly the same shade of black. What you want to do is come as close as possible. This holds true of your belt too. Ideally you ought to select a hat, boots, and a belt that are the same basic colors.</strong></p>\n<p>The rest of your outfit should be a contrasting color. You really do not want to wear attire that is all the same color. What you can do is keep these style guidelines in mind when you are purchasing the pieces to your outfit. Trust us, you will look very dashing.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What about women wearing a hat with cowgirl boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>The same fashion rules are true for the ladies. A woman should wear similarly colored boots with her hat. If she wears a belt, that ought to match up as well. </strong></p>\n<p>Some people will tell you not to wear fringe, sequins, or rhinestone outfits with your hat and boots. We take the opposite view. If you have ever observed participants in a western-themed parade, you will see this all the time. They look smashingly great doing so. Go ahead and wear them!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What is the cowboy hat rule?</h2>\n<p><strong>We have been discussing this throughout our blog. </strong>The rule actually is, if you are not an authentic cowboy or cowgirl, you should not be wearing such attire. There are people who will be offended by it and could act aggressively towards those who violate this rule.</p>\n<p>The flip side is, rules are meant to be broken. New fashion trends are always emerging. If you decide you want to wear a cowboy hat and matching boots, who is going to stop you? You might be part of the newest fashion revolution and inspire others to follow suit.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What color should my cowboy hat be?</h2>\n<p><strong>It can be any color you choose. If you love cowboy hats, why stop at one? You can own several of them, each a different color. </strong>Then have a pair of boots that go with each hat. The rest of your attire looks best if the colors compliment that hat and boots.</p>\n<p>There are certain colors associated with special occasions. For example, a black cowboy hat with finely-stitched black western boots is appropriate to wear to dressy events. It is best if you find out the rules of etiquette when wearing the hat. You want to know when it can be on your head and when you must remove it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>As we stated earlier, fashion rules like these are someone else's opinion on how you should look. When it comes right down to it, you ought to wear what you want. There is no wrong opinion. A person needs to feel comfortable with their attire, no matter what items they wear.</p>\n<p>Do you want to wear a cowboy hat with boots? Then go right ahead! We are willing to bet you receive a wealth of compliments. It is your life, enjoy what you choose to adorn your body with!</p>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<h2>What color cowboy boots go with everything?</h2>\n<p><strong>The best color cowboy boots that go with everything is black. Whether you are dressing for work, a fancy occasion, or simply doing chores, black cowboy boots will go with your outfit. </strong></p>\n<p>You might want to own more than one pair. One can be a simple black cowboy boot, while the other has intricate designs in black leather. Which pair you choose to wear will depend on how dressy you want to look.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Why black cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>Think about your everyday clothes and shoes. When you want a color outfit for any occasion, one piece can be black while the other is any color. Your shoes can also be black. Now your outfit looks totally coordinated.</strong></p>\n<p>Now apply this same logic to choosing your cowboy boots. Even if you only wish to own one pair, that pair should be black. Then you can rest easy knowing you will always look terrific. If you only intend to wear them for dressy occasions, select a pair with a nice design.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What color cowboy boots are most versatile?</h2>\n<p><strong>If this is your first ever pair of cowboy boots, your best bet is to go with tan or a rich brown. At this point you probably will not be wearing them to special events anyhow. You should definitely avoid beige or an odd color boot such as red, yellow, or green.</strong></p>\n<p>That said, if you are buying them specifically to wear at a dressy social event, then you want black. Black is the most dressy of all the colors of cowboy boots. If you select a pair with an intricate stitching pattern, you will look terrific.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Can cowboy boots go with everything?</h2>\n<p><strong>Years ago the answer would have been no. However, society has changed and along with that, fashion rules have changed. Today a fine pair of cowboy boots can be worn with suits or even tuxedos. For women, they can go with pantsuits, skirts, and even dresses. </strong></p>\n<p>One thing to keep in mind is to make sure the color of your boots goes with your attire. Ideally, if you want to wear cowboy boots, you should have many different colors. This is so you will have a pair to compliment any color outfit. If you can only afford one or two pairs of boots, choose black, brown, or tan.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Can you wear cowboy boots with skinny jeans?</h2>\n<p><strong>Yes, in fact this fashion trend is quite popular with men, women, and kids. When you want to make a fashion statement while out running everyday errands, wear this combination. Just make sure the colors can go together.</strong></p>\n<p>In the case of skinny jeans, the cowboy boots will always be worn on the outside of the jeans. Trying to fit skinny jeans over the outside of the cowboy boots is plain silly. You will look ridiculous. Wearing your boots properly on the outside of your skinny jeans will make you look sensational.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Do brown cowboy boots go with everything?</h2>\n<p><strong>Yes, if you already own a nice pair of brown cowboy boots, you are in luck. They can go with pretty much everything. You might see rock stars wearing a stylish pair of them with their onstage attire. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>As a sign of the times, you will also notice many men wearing a black or grey suit with brown cowboy boots as well. He appears very handsome no matter what outfit he wears with his brown boots.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>What about women and brown cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>She will look extremely classy wearing them with a knit top and leggings. Women can also adorn brown cowboy boots with a lace dress or a skating-style dress. </strong></p>\n<p>We already discussed how appropriate it is to wear skinny jeans with cowboy boots. We will add that those boots can be any shade of brown. If she tops that off with a faux-fur jacket, she will look amazing!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Can kids wear brown cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>Yes, they can, and they need not look silly trying to fit into adult-sized boots. Many makers of cowboy boots create models just for kids. </strong>Not only will these boots fit the kids very well, but the designs are more appropriate for their age. Their family and friends are going to be envious and probably want their own cowboy boots.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p><strong>We have covered a lot of ground in this article. The main thing for the reader to take away from it is that either black, or brown, or tan, is a great color cowboy boot to have. Of these, if you are only into owning one pair, the black is your best choice. You will never go wrong wearing these. </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

Not only that, but there are various weird designs they can come with, and have odd shapes to boot! With that pun intended, we’ll explore the mysterious pointed toe in cowboy boots, what its functions are, and what other purposes it can serve.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Why do cowboy boots curl up? It could mean the boot materials are wearing out.</strong></h2>\n<p>If you’ve seen someone wearing a worn-out pair of cowboy boots with toes pointed at the sky, which could mean those boots have seen better days. With <em>any</em> kind of footwear, how you use it day to day matters.</p>\n<p>It’s very possible that that pair you’ve seen is made of <a href=\"https://oureverydaylife.com/what-causes-shoes-to-curl-up-12621056.html\">cheap materials</a>. A quality pair of cowboy boots is typically made of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_boot\">cowhide leather</a>, and can last for years on end. However, if a pair is made of something cheaper than that, then wearing out to the point of pointed toes is much more likely to happen.</p>\n<p>Even for those made of genuine leather, wear and tear can still happen if the wearer uses them every day. Some veteran boot enthusiasts recommend getting an <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboyboots/comments/8ema4r/how_many_of_you_wear_your_boots_everyday/\">extra pair</a> that you can switch out with to avoid your boots from breaking down too fast.</p>\n<p>Another factor that could lead to pointed toes is certain weather conditions. Walking around in the snow or rain can cause the boot materials to expand, and therefore curl at the toes. The materials don’t have to be poor quality to have this happen either, as leather cowboy boots <a href=\"https://horseracingsense.com/cowboy-boots-waterproof-leather-snow/\">aren't exactly waterproof</a>. They may be “water resistant,” but will inevitably degrade if exposed to enough wet and cold.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Are cowboy boots curling up normal? It was part of their original design. </strong></h2>\n<p>Ever since their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_boot\">inception</a>, cowboy boots have been used by ranchers to help do all kinds of outdoor work. Originally, the pointed toe helped cowboys (and cowgirls) easily slip their feet into <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/why-do-cowboy-boots-curl-up/\">horse stirrups</a>. The heel also helped the rider keep their boots securely in place for long journeys.</p>\n<p>Seeing how some of the first cowboy boots had <a href=\"https://rmkshoes.com/why-are-cowboy-boots-pointed/\">rounded toes</a>, wearers noted how hard it was getting onto their horses, and therefore, the pointed toe was born. Think of it like feeding a thread through a needle. The more pointed the thread (cowboy boot toe), the easier it will be to insert.</p>\n<p>Seeing pointed toes in cowboy boots can be perfectly normal. It could be just a simple fashion statement, or that person is a serious horse rider that needs every advantage he/she can get!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What type of cowboy boots are known for curling up? J toe, D toe, and Trival. </strong></h2>\n<p>Whereas the J and D toe are both used for slipping into stirrups, they have some slight differences. The J toe is <a href=\"https://rmkshoes.com/why-are-cowboy-boots-pointed/\">sharper</a> than the D, which has a “snipped” toe with a blunt tip at its point. Also, the D toe has more space for the wearer’s toes in comparison.</p>\n<p>If you were to travel around Mexico for a while, you might come across <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_pointy_boots\">trival boots</a> or “Mexican pointy boots.” These are truly a sight to behold, due to their outlandish designs and pointy tips that can be longer than the boots themselves! These boots started fairly recently, as early as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_pointy_boots\">2010</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Are pointed toes specific to a brand or a certain style? Both! </strong></h2>\n<p>As we’ve already established, the pointed toes on cowboy boots can both serve function <em>and</em> form. It simply depends on the person wearing them and what their needs and wants are.</p>\n<p>A while back, pointed toes were also a <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-do-cowboy-boots-curl-up\">specific style</a> that people liked to wear. These boots were jammed against the wall <em>on purpose</em> to achieve that iconic pointed look.</p>\n<p>For those part of the trival culture, they use their pointed boots to perform in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_pointy_boots\">all-male dance troupes</a>. These unique dancers participate in competitions through carefully coordinated dance moves. Such performances aren’t just for show either, some of these competitions come with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_pointy_boots\">prize money</a> on the line!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Bonus content: taking good care of your boots.</strong></h2>\n<p>Unless you <em>want</em> your boots to have pointed toes, be wary of how you treat your boots in day-to-day wear. Having the toes curled up can be a sign that those cowboy boots are breaking down.</p>\n<p>To prevent this, it’s important that you wear them in appropriate conditions, meaning avoiding poor weather and uneven terrain when you can. Even though cowboy boots aren’t waterproof by definition, you can still <a href=\"https://horseracingsense.com/cowboy-boots-waterproof-leather-snow/\">increase</a> their water resistance by applying products like mink oil.</p>\n<p>Another technique is using a <a href=\"https://oureverydaylife.com/what-causes-shoes-to-curl-up-12621056.html\">shoe tree</a>, a shaped block that can be inserted into the boots whenever you’re not wearing them. Doing so will help maintain the boot shape you want.</p>\n<p>However, the most important tip could be selecting the right pair of cowboy boots in the first place. Simply put, make sure your boots fit comfortably. If they’re too big or too small for your feet, the toes will inevitably curl over time because of your uneven foot strikes while you walk.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>Pointed toes on cowboy boots can be both an oddity and a regular sight, depending on who you ask. Whether for function or for form, the pointed toe is here to stay.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>You’ve seen them around. That slick leather-made footwear. Cowboy boots are worn by all kinds of people everywhere. Yet, do some professions allow them? What if that person were a surgeon? In this article, we’ll discuss the answer to that question and more!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Why do surgeons wear cowboy boots? Some say they’re highly functional.</strong></h2>\n<p>When your job requires you to stand for hours on end, you’ll need some serious support for your feet. One <a href=\"https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/do-your-feet-a-favor-wear-cowboy-boots/273223/\">surgeon</a> claims that his cowboy boots give him “a built-in heel lift” that reduces stress on his Achilles tendon. Not only that, cowboy boots can also give surgeons overall “solid support” because of rigid metal shanks within the soles.</p>\n<p>In this case, surgeons need footwear that won’t cause them problems later on in the day. It’s also recommended that any surgeon shopping for cowboy boots get a pair that has <a href=\"https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/do-your-feet-a-favor-wear-cowboy-boots/273223/\">more room in the toe box</a> like a rounded or square toe.</p>\n<p>The material that cowboy boots are made of can also factor in to the wearer’s overall comfortability. Some materials like ostrich leather are more “forgiving” towards those who suffer from bunions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Do doctors wear cowboy boots? Yes they do. </strong></h2>\n<p>One doctor describes how his pair of cowboy boots <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Can-surgeons-wear-any-shoes\">protect his feet</a> from all the gore and guts that comes with surgery. Most surgeons are required to wear something that is waterproof so they don’t risk contaminating their feet with someone else’s bodily fluids.</p>\n<p>Whereas not exactly waterproof, cowboy boots are highly <a href=\"https://horseracingsense.com/cowboy-boots-waterproof-leather-snow/\">water resistant</a> and can take a bit of punishment. However, it's not recommended that the wearer expose the boots to things like snow and excessive moisture too often, lest the leather on the boots crack and dry.</p>\n<p>With that being said, there are certain <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=mink+oil+for+leather&amp;linkCode=gs3&amp;linkId=14aca1efebe9d0f444342d27cd2da62a&amp;tag=horseracing04-20&amp;ref=as_li_ss_tl\">products</a> one can get to make cowboy boots even more water resistant. They don’t seem that expensive either, as anyone wanting to strengthen their footwear can buy things like mink oil for just over $10.</p>\n<p>For the most part, surgeons and other kinds of medical doctors can wear any kind of footwear they please, as long as they follow proper sterile procedures. When delivering babies, for example, doctors are required to slip on <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Can-surgeons-wear-any-shoes\">disposable waterproof boots</a> over whatever shoes or boots they’re wearing at the time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What is the purpose of wearing cowboy boots? Function <em>and</em> style. </strong></h2>\n<p>Ever since the late 1800s, cowboy boots have been used extensively by common folk. One of the <a href=\"https://stageswest.com/blog/benefits-of-wearing-cowboy-boots/\">earliest innovations</a> of the cowboy boots, the toe shape, was made in such a way that it easily allows the wearer to get boots in and out of stirrups.</p>\n<p>And that gift keeps on giving. The cowboy boot design also allows the wearer to remain firm within the stirrups while riding a horse. Also, the tough leather cowboy boots are made to protect the wearer from bushes, cacti, thorns, branches, and snakes!</p>\n<p>Even today, cowboy boots are used for the same purposes. They’re also quite comfortable to wear, especially if the wearer gets them properly fitted. And seeing how they don’t use laces, anyone can slip them on and off at their leisure, as well as keep them on for long periods of time without the worry of any laces coming undone.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What shoes do surgeons wear during surgery? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>They can wear just about anything they want. However, some shoes serve their purposes better than others.</strong></p>\n<p>As we’ve established already, cowboy boots may not be the best kind of footwear for surgeons due to the need for waterproofing around their feet. Shoes such as <a href=\"https://testprepnerds.com/mcat/best-shoes-surgeons/\">Crocs</a> are preferred for the operating room due to their slip resistance.</p>\n<p>And like cowboy boots, doctors who do surgery often prefer something that they can easily slip on and off, like a pair of clogs, for example. Whereas certain kinds of shoes (with laces) are worn by surgeons as well, it’s much more convenient to slip your feet in and forget them before an important job.</p>\n<p>Another feature surgeons look out for is <a href=\"https://testprepnerds.com/mcat/best-shoes-surgeons/\">protection</a> against sharp objects, cold, and impact injuries to their feet. Some OR rooms can be uncomfortably chilly, and standing still in this environment can sap away all the feet warmth.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Are cowboy boots comfortable to wear for long periods of time? They can be. </strong></h2>\n<p>This is where a potential owner of cowboy boots should look out for function over style. This is because shopping for <a href=\"https://horseracingsense.com/are-cowboy-boots-comfortable/\">style alone</a> can leave the wearer disappointed (and possibly injured!). The key here is, take your time when browsing around for this iconic kind of footwear. Chances are that you’ll have your new boots for a long time to come. Cowboy boots, if properly taken care of, can last for <a href=\"https://stageswest.com/blog/benefits-of-wearing-cowboy-boots/\">years on end</a>.</p>\n<p>Even if you find the right pair for you, you’ll still need to <a href=\"https://horseracingsense.com/how-break-in-ariat-leather-cowboy-boots/\">break into them</a> so that they mold to the shape of your feet. This process is made much easier when you obtain a pair that actually fits. One way to speed up the process even further is using <a href=\"https://horseracingsense.com/how-break-in-ariat-leather-cowboy-boots/\">steam</a> to soften the leather, making it relaxed enough to mold over a short period of time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>Keep in mind that even though surgeons like to wear cowboy boots at work, you don’t need to be a medical doctor to enjoy their full benefits. As we’ve surmised, cowboy boots are tough, comfortable, and stylish enough for just about any job out there.</p>",
