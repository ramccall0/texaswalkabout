            "content_html": "<p>To walk a mile in someone else’s shoes, you first have to know what kinds of shoes are being worn in the first place. When comparing footwear, it helps to know what makes them different from one another.</p>\n<p>This is especially the case when comparing cowboy boots with dress shoes. Whether you need function over form, or vice-versa, in this article, we’ll go into detail on what sets cowboy boots apart from their fancier dress shoe cousins.</p>\n<h2><strong>When should you wear cowboy boots instead of dress shoes? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Pick cowboy boots if you’ll be spending a lot of time outdoors.</strong></p>\n<p>Ever since their inception in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, cowboy boots have been made primarily for comfort, safety, and durability.</p>\n<p>Considering the rugged environments they had to endure at the time (and still do today), cowboy boots can last up to a <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/how-long-do-cowboy-boots-last/\">whopping 10 years</a> or more due to the leather they’re made of.</p>\n<p>Cheaper brands, of course, will last less than that, but will still provide the same function and reliability in the short term.</p>\n<p>Now, it’s easy to see why you wouldn’t wear dress shoes on the ranch in place of boots. For work like that, you’ll need something tough enough for the job.</p>\n<p>Cowboy boots can <em>also</em> be used for formal events, provided you’re in the right place. Specifically, you’d choose cowboy boots over dress shoes if the formal event has a strong western theme to it.</p>\n<h2><strong>Do boots count as dress shoes? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>No, they don’t. </strong></p>\n<p>With that being said, it’s possible to get a fancy pair of \"dress cowboy boots,\" but many agree that boots are more <a href=\"https://moralcode.com/can-i-wear-boots-with-a-suit/\">casual</a> than dress shoes. For most formal events, go with dress shoes unless you’re expected to wear western things.</p>\n<p>Boots are also very different from dress shoes structure-wise. A boot, by standard definition, is defined as <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/boot\">a fitted covering (as of leather or rubber) for the foot that usually reaches above the ankle</a>.</p>\n<p>Shoes in this light have a shorter construction, with most having little to no ankle support depending on the type.</p>\n<h2><strong>What similarities do cowboy boots and dress shoes share? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Both are fairly durable. </strong></p>\n<p>Similar to cowboy boots, dress shoes can last a long time, especially if the shoe in question is made of leather. However, not all styles of dress shoes are the same. The more durable varieties include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Derby</li>\n<li>Oxfords</li>\n<li>Loafers</li>\n<li>Brogues</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these types are “hand-stitched” and typically made of the same stuff that quality cowboy boots are. When quality stitching and leather are combined, you’re sure to get durable footwear no matter the style.</p>\n<h2><strong>What differences do cowboy boots and dress shoes have? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Many. </strong></p>\n<p>Considering their purpose, cowboy boots are incredibly different from dress shoes. Whereas boots are better at function, waterproofness, and safety, dress shoes have the advantage of being more comfortable, more breathable, more fashionable, and slightly more versatile than their western-style cousins.</p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, if the function you’re attending requires you to be outdoors a lot, stick with cowboy boots as they will protect your feet way better than any dress shoe can.</p>\n<p>They don’t necessarily have to be of the cowboy variety either, as several kinds of <a href=\"https://moralcode.com/can-i-wear-boots-with-a-suit/\">dress boots</a> also exist.</p>\n<p>When it comes to fashion, dress shoes are simply better in that department due to the huge variety of forms they come in.</p>\n<p>This can also allow the wearer to look good in more types of environments than any pair of cowboy boots can.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do cowboy boots and dress shoes compare in comfortability? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Dress shoes tend to be a bit better for this. </strong></p>\n<p>This is partly due to the freedom your ankles get when wearing dress shoes. With this feature, you get better footing, allowing you to avoid a nasty dislocation or ankle sprain.</p>\n<p>With cowboy boots, you may be able to tuck your pants into the ankle covers should the need arise, but if you’re not used to wearing boots, you can expect your feet to develop blisters after a while.</p>\n<p>This situation is all the more likely if the cowboy boots in question have tapered heels and narrow toes.</p>\n<p>Another factor to consider is the breathability of cowboy boots and dress shoes.</p>\n<p>Not only do dress shoes have more room for your legs and feet to cool off, but they tend to be made of less “water-resistant” materials, which is what cowboy boots need to protect the wearer from water and heat.</p>\n<h2><strong>How do cowboy boots and dress shoes compare in price? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Dress shoes will be more expensive overall, whereas cowboy boots are more expensive on average. </strong></p>\n<p>Some dress shoes can reach up to the <a href=\"https://www.harryrosen.com/en/product/tom-ford-elkan-whole-cut-oxfords-20058184?gclid=CjwKCAjw_tWRBhAwEiwALxFPocC9t8xl66GZuDn1UK1zYc4Ds0ew9YsAmaEWkSEZWIZ0wEkS52oMRhoCpwYQAvD_BwE\">thousands of dollars</a> depending on which pair you want to buy.</p>\n<p>However, such pairs are top-of-the-line, whereas more casual dress shoes will typically range around <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Dress+shoes&amp;crid=2ENC8GDF5GPS5&amp;sprefix=dress+shoe%2Caps%2C132&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2\">50 dollars</a> for a decent pair.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the average cost of cowboy boots, a quality pair will usually be more expensive.</p>\n<p>Want a pair that will last you a decade or longer? Be prepared to dish out <a href=\"https://horseracingsense.com/how-much-is-a-good-pair-of-cowboy-boots/\">200 to 1000</a> dollars. This depends, of course, which brand you go with, and other types of cowboy boots out there can be as little as 50 dollars.</p>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>Cowboy boots won’t fit for every occasion, but neither will dress shoes. Now that you have a bit more knowledge than before, pick whatever suits your footwear needs best.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>As a country person at heart, you may be wondering if you can wear cowboy boots to an interview. In this article, we will discuss whether you can wear cowboy boots to an interview, what kind of boots to wear to an interview, why someone would wear cowboy boots to an interview, and how to wear cowboy boots with dress pants. We will also cover what color boots to choose for an interview and whether to clean your boots before the interview.</strong></p>\n<h2>Can you wear cowboy boots to an interview?</h2>\n<p><strong>The short answer is, yes, you can wear cowboy boots to a job interview–as long as they are dress boots that match your interview attire. </strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Additionally, it is important to shine and clean your dress cowboy boots beforehand to make a neat first impression.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What kind of boots can I wear to an interview?</h2>\n<p><strong>Unless your work requires a specific type of boots–such as ranch work or manufacturing–dress cowboy boots in a matching color scheme to your outfit are the best option for an interview.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For very casual job interviews, you may be able to get away with wearing regular cowboy boots. If your interview takes place on a ranch and is related to a ranch position, regular cowboy boots might be the most practical choice. Don’t be afraid to ask an interviewer what dress or shoes they recommend for the interview.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If there is a skills component to the interview on a ranch filled with mud and horse manure, you may regret bringing your best boots. However, in an office setting or a corporate setting, taking the time to polish and clean dress cowboy boots can make the difference between scoring the job and receiving a rejection email.</p>\n<h2>Why would you wear cowboy boots to an interview?</h2>\n<p><strong>You may want to wear cowboy boots to an interview because they are comfortable, stylish, and convey your personality in a bold way. </strong></p>\n<p>Plus, cowboy boots are always in season. Whether you are interviewing in the summer, spring, winter, or fall, cowboy boots will keep your feet comfortable. When you feel comfortable, you can stride into an interview with confidence.</p>\n<p>Besides style and personal expression, cowboy boots might be the most practical choice for an interview in outdoor work, maintenance, manufacturing, or agriculture. Especially if you expect to work with livestock, cowboy boots are a natural choice.</p>\n<h2>Should you clean your boots beforehand?</h2>\n<p><strong>You should clean your boots before the interview, regardless of what type of work you intend to get.</strong></p>\n<p>Even if you might get muddy at the interview site, walking in with polished boots gives the impression that you pay attention to details. An interviewer will undoubtedly take notice. When you put your best foot forward–pun intended!–you increase your chances of moving forward in the hiring process.</p>\n<p>Although it is a seemingly small task, cleaning your boots before the big day shows that you have a work ethic and take pride in your work. Whether it feels right or not, the truth is, employers will take notice of this.</p>\n<h2>Wearing dress pants with boots</h2>\n<p><strong>When you wear dress pants with boots, opt for either a leg that is wide enough to go over the boots or a leg that is tapered enough to fit into the boots. </strong></p>\n<p>Make sure that the pants are long enough to cover the ankles but not so long that they drag on the floor and risk getting caught under a cowboy boot’s heel.</p>\n<h2>What color boots should you wear to an interview?</h2>\n<p><strong>The color of boots to wear to an interview strongly depends on the color of the rest of your outfit. </strong></p>\n<p>When in doubt, neutral tones like black, brown, gray, and navy are a good place to start. Avoid anything flashy like red or metallic-colored boots. Also, avoid complicated designs unless you are interviewing to work at a specialty retailer that sells designer cowboy boots.</p>\n<p>It may also be best to keep white and cream boots in the closet on an interview day. After all, white and cream tones are a blank canvas for dirt and stains to occupy for the long haul. No amount of cleaning or shining can turn some light-colored boots back to their original clean slate. Plus, no one wants to accidentally step in mud minutes before walking into the interview and letting everyone see it on their boots.</p>\n<p>For a professional look that is guaranteed to stay sharp all day, go for the darkest colored boots that will match the rest of your outfit. Beige and warm-toned interview clothes will probably match best with brown, whereas more colorful, bright interview clothes might coordinate better with blue or navy. Use your best judgment and know that while shoe color is important, it will most likely not make or break your interview experience.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p><strong>In conclusion, you can absolutely wear cowboy boots to a job interview–don’t let anyone tell you differently! Just shine and clean the boots the night before the job interview, choose a dress pair of boots to stand out as a serious professional with personality (and stay comfortable), and choose dress pants that either cover the boots or tuck into them. For color, opt for boots that match the rest of your outfit and stay in a neutral color palette if possible.</strong></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>If you’re a nurse who enjoys incorporating a country flair into your style, then you probably wonder if nurses can wear cowboy boots. In this article, we will discuss whether nurses can wear cowboy boots, whether nurses can wear cowboy boots with scrubs, whether nurses should be wearing cowboy boots, what kind of cowboy boots a nurse would wear, and what areas of the U.S. allow nurses to wear cowboy boots.</strong></p>\n<h2>Can nurses wear cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>The short answer is, it depends on the individual nurse’s hospital policies, state policies, and personal comfort level.</strong></p>\n<p>In some cases, nurses are forbidden from wearing cowboy boots to work because they violate the dress code. Cowboy boots frequently have heels that exceed the height limit for nursing staff on the floor.</p>\n<p>In their free time outside of the medical setting, nurses are welcome to wear cowboy boots. On the job, it may be a different story. Nurses should always consult with their supervisors before attempting to wear unusual footwear to work. Wearing inappropriate shoes can jeopardize the safety of the patients and the nursing staff. After all, the wrong shoes can cause slipping, falling, tripping, slowed mobility, and pain after being on our feet for a full shift.</p>\n<p>If you work in a hospital where others openly wear cowboy boots, though, it may be a good indicator that your particular workplace and state approve of cowboy boots on nurses. In this case, feel free to rock your favorite cowboy boots on the floor.</p>\n<h2>Can you wear cowboy boots with scrubs?</h2>\n<p><strong>As long as the scrubs are wide-legged enough to cover the boots and your hospital allows cowboy boots in the dress code, you should be able to wear cowboy boots with scrubs.</strong></p>\n<p>You may be tempted to tuck a more tapered scrub pant-leg into cowboy boots to show them off. We would not recommend tucking the scrubs into the boots because it could cause fluids to drip into your shoes. There are many reasons why this could cause issues for your health, safety, and comfort.</p>\n<h2>Should nurses be wearing cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>We think so–provided that they are safe for a nurse’s specific duties! </strong></p>\n<p>Cowboy boots are a comfortable, stylish footwear option that shows solidarity with a team and traditional country values. While nurses need to consider the safety of themselves and their patients–as well as their professional expectations–there is no reason why nurses should not wear cowboy boots if they can perform their job well in them.</p>\n<p>As individuals, nurses should decide whether cowboy boots are the best fit for them. However, especially in rural areas where cowboy boots are the norm, these boots can help nurses create a meaningful connection with their patients by sharing the local style and make nurses feel stylish even on the most hectic days. As long as the dress code does not forbid cowboy boots or similar shoes, nurses should feel free to enjoy wearing their favorite cowboy boots.</p>\n<p>The only consideration that may be worth taking before wearing cowboy boots to work is that nursing can be a messy, fast-paced profession. As long as you are comfortable knowing that bodily fluids will almost certainly find their way onto your precious boots and you will almost certainly eventually have to run in these boots, knock yourself out!</p>\n<h2>What kind of cowboy boots would a nurse wear?</h2>\n<p><strong>A nurse would most likely want to find cowboy boots with a low heel, slip-resistant sole, and comfortable material.</strong></p>\n<p>Nurses should also, as we mentioned earlier, consult with the appropriate staff to ensure that cowboy boots are permitted in their work setting. Also, avoiding dress cowboy boots for nursing work is probably best.</p>\n<h2>What areas of the U.S. are cowboy boots in hospitals acceptable?</h2>\n<p><strong>While Texas is the most permissive state when it comes to cowboy boots–when everyone else is wearing them, how could they forbid nurses from doing the same?--other states have been known to accept cowboy boots in hospitals.</strong></p>\n<p>Rural hospitals tend to favor cowboy boots more than urban areas. This might be a cultural difference or a style difference. Whatever the reason, as long as your hospital does not forbid cowboy boots or features on cowboy boots such as a heel, it does not matter what others think. Cowboy boots are a tool of personal expression. As long as it is not hurting anyone or tarnishing your professional reputation, hold your head high and sport cowboy boots if that is what you want to do.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p><strong>In short, nurses can wear cowboy boots in certain settings and places. In places where they are allowed, nurses can wear cowboy boots with scrubs. Whether nurses should be wearing cowboy boots is entirely up to the individual and the employer. A nurse would wear comfortable, slip-resistant, low-heeled cowboy boots. Cowboy boots are most acceptable in rural areas and states with large country-dwelling populations, such as Texas.</strong></p>",

See, you do have options!</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Are cowboy boots good for hunting?</h2>\n<p>In the past, there were not any options for this. Today they make cowboy boots for multiple purposes. It is possible to buy them in a style and look that are attractive while still using them for an activity such as hunting. Nowadays, there are choices.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that, when you go hunting, it typically involves hiking through rocky, wooded terrain. If you were dressy cowboy boots, you will not get around so well. You need a brand and model of boot that is better for hunting trips.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Are leather boots OK for hunting?</h2>\n<p>They are if you buy the right ones. If you buy a stylish-looking pair of leather cowboy boots with narrow toe area and a higher heel, do not attempt to go hunting in those. If you ignore our advice, you will be miserable. This style of boot is not good for things like that.</p>\n<p>As we said, in today's boot market, there are varieties of leather cowboy boots that are fine for hunting or other outdoor activities. Expect to have to clean these boots after every hunting trip or other outdoor event. Otherwise, dirt and mud will get caked up on the boots and ruin them.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Is there a difference amongst boot types?</h2>\n<p>In reality, yes. There are boots make for formal events and those made for night-life. There are some made for hiking and some made for hunting. Then you can find boots suitable to work in. Cowboy boot makers have adjusted to this though. More and more makers are creating models that are multi-functional.</p>\n<p>These specific boot crafters recognized the need for multipurpose cowboy boots and set out to accommodate this need. We would say they have succeeded. There are probably hundreds of versions on the market today. You will discover some that you can use for an activity such as hunting and not worry. Make sure you try them on before buying them to ensure they are comfortable.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Why would you wear cowboy boots while hunting?</h2>\n<p>There are some people, both men and women, who insist on wearing cowboy boots for every occasion. They are usually boot aficionados who know which kind to buy for which purpose. These folks will always find just the right pair of boots.</p>\n<p>While sites like ours can make suggestions, it is really up to the individual to decide what to buy. If they choose to wear cowboy boots hunting, who is going to stop them. There really is no such thing as fashion police. Who cares what other people think anyhow. If you want to do this, go right ahead!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What are snake-proof cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p>In reality, there is no such thing. While leather cowboy boots will protect the bottom of your feet from snake bites, they do not from bites on the top and side of your feet. If you are within prime striking distance of a snake, it is possible for the bite to pierce the leather. Truth be told, you are best off wearing a boot with a tougher material that is better for evading snakes when you go hunting. Save your cowboy boots for other uses.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Can women wear cowboy boots when hunting?</h2>\n<p>Really, the same answer applies as it does to men. She should select pairs specifically geared towards rugged activity. She will want to visit a store that focuses on the many styles of cowboy boots. This is her best opportunity to find what she needs.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Advice for men and women about this topic</h2>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, it is important to go to a physical store to look for these. You can tell the salesperson exactly what you want and try each pair on until you strike gold. If you intend to go hunting often, perhaps by more than one pair as long as you are at the store. A person cannot own too many pairs of cowboy boots!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>In the end, it is your feet we are talking about. If you really want to wear cowboy boots on hunting trips, we aren't going to tell you not to. In this case, do not expect the boots to last very long though. They will undergo a lot of punishment on hunting and hiking trips. It is also your money. If you want to shell it out for scores of pairs of boots, by all means do it!</p>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>You have an important flight coming up. After planning out accommodations for your arrival, buying your ticket, and packing all your luggage, a question still nags at you. You want to wear some cowboy boots for your trip, but can you? In this article, we’ll discuss the details surrounding this traditional type of footwear when going through checkout and flight.</p>\n<h2><strong>Should I wear cowboy boots on a plane? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>That’s up to you. </strong></p>\n<p>It’s not so much a matter of whether you <em>should</em> or not, but if you’re allowed to. The TSA themselves stated that <a href=\"https://travelinglight.com/can-you-wear-steel-toe-boots-on-a-plane/\">all boots and shoes are allowed on planes</a>, so if you want to rock the boots of a cowboy, go right ahead! However, if there’s any steel or metal inside your boots, it’s more than likely that TSA agents will ask you to remove your footwear while passing through check out.</p>\n<p>One exception is if your boots have something dangerous on them, such as decorative metal spikes. Anything that the TSA deems as a <a href=\"https://www.catsa-acsta.gc.ca/en/sharp-objects\">sharp object</a> might require you to pack your boots with checked luggage.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why would I wear cowboy boots on a plane? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Some say it’s more comfortable.</strong></p>\n<p>Chances are that flights will take hours on end to get from one place to another. It helps to have footwear that you can keep on the entire way. Some sources say that cowboy boots are more <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAcEp8zIBqU\">comfortable</a> than any other shoe.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to note that keeping on any kind of boot or shoe will make your feet stinky and sweaty. Cowboy boots are known to avoid this problem, and will simply smell like “leather” no matter how long you wear them for.</p>\n<h2><strong>Can airline pilots wear cowboy boots? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Pilot dress codes usually don’t permit them.</strong></p>\n<p>Most pilots today have to abide by an <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Are-airline-pilots-allowed-to-wear-Stetsons-or-are-they-only-allowed-to-wear-the-hat-thats-part-of-their-uniform-Would-it-be-acceptable-for-a-pilot-to-wear-a-Stetson-and-cowboy-boots\">approved uniform</a> rule that doesn’t allow cowboy boots or “Stetsons” while flying. This wasn’t the case before the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_pilot_uniforms\">1930's</a>, where wearing boots would’ve been the norm for most pilots.</p>\n<p>The present-day rule, however, was formed under a “Collective Bargaining Agreement,” with <em>most</em> airline companies signing on. It’s possible that there’s a pilot or two that will wear cowboy boots, just don’t expect to see them anytime soon.</p>\n<h2><strong>Can you wear cowboy boots anywhere? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>You can, but for some places it might seem inappropriate. </strong></p>\n<p>When out in public, no police officer will stop and demand that you change your boots for something else. You may, however, receive lots of attention by wearing cowboy boots. When doing so, it helps to wear <a href=\"https://menandboots.com/how-to-wear-cowboy-boots\">other cowboy things</a> as well to get the best western look possible.</p>\n<p>As for major events, such as weddings and romantic evenings with a significant other, wearing such boots will be accepted by a majority of people. Heck, some events even <em>expect</em> you to wear cowboy boots, especially for country concerts, and anything involving horses.</p>\n<p>As we established already, it’s also okay to wear cowboy boots inside airports and onboard planes. However, some events where you should <em>avoid</em> wearing them include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Modern clubs (unless western-themed, avoid wearing cowboy gear)</li>\n<li>Theater functions</li>\n<li>Political events</li>\n<li>Dates (unless your SO is okay with cowboy wear)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The fact of the matter is, wearing cowboy boots sends a bold message, and you’ll need a hefty amount of confidence to pull off the look in full. If you simply don’t care, go ahead and wear them anyway, just be mindful of your <em>purpose</em> of wearing cowboy boots in the first place.</p>\n<h2><strong>Will you have any problems going through TSA if you’re wearing cowboy boots?</strong></h2>\n<p><strong> You shouldn’t, unless there’s a lot of metal inside them. </strong></p>\n<p>Some claim that wearing cowboy boots makes it <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboyboots/comments/qoxat7/do_you_wear_boots_while_flying/\">easier to go through TSA checks</a> due to the ability to slip them on and off with ease. Whether you’re asked to remove them or not is just about anyone’s guess. It depends on the agent and if there’s any metal within your footwear (you might set off the metal detectors).</p>\n<p>Even if your cowboy boots are somewhat metallic, the TSA says it’s <a href=\"https://travelinglight.com/can-you-wear-steel-toe-boots-on-a-plane/\">okay</a> to travel with them on the plane, provided they don’t have any dangerous sharp accessories. Even if you have to remove them regardless, it won’t be much of a hassle to do so.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are some good cowboy boot brands for wearing on a plane? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Pick ones that will keep you comfortable.</strong></p>\n<p>Some brands to consider include Justin and Old Gringo, but what’s even more important is that your boots are <a href=\"https://footwearheights.com/shoes-taller-not-elevator/best-cowboy-boots-brands-men-women/\">breathable</a> so that your feet don’t end up sweating too much. Even though cowboy boots aren’t known to stink too often, it’s still uncomfortable to have your feet locked inside sweltering and hot footwear. Focus less on the brand of boots, and more on what feels good to walk around in.</p>\n<p>In the off-chance that you’re expected to place your cowboy boots in checked luggage, you can use this <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/how-do-you-pack-cowboy-boots-in-a-suitcase/\">helpful guide</a> as how to pack them away without causing damage. This would be a good idea to consider well <em>before</em> arriving at the airport (check the rules online), so you don’t have to end up walking around in just your socks.</p>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>Everyone has their choice of style, and wearing cowboy boots on a plane won’t cause you much trouble. No matter where you’re going, be assured that your slick western footwear will follow you, even high in the sky.</p>",

It shields the wearer from sun and rain, and also brings out the rugged coolness in just about anybody.</p>\n<p>Yet, are there unspoken rules for wearing one? In this article, we’ll go over some dos and don’ts regarding the famous (and somewhat infamous) cowboy hat, other things you can wear to match it, and what certain hat colors can mean.</p>\n<h2><strong>What are the rules regarding the color of cowboy hats? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Color won’t matter as much, but the rules of wearing cowboy hats will. </strong></p>\n<p>Unless specified by a unique group of cowboy hat wearers, feel free to wear any hat color you want. Traditionally, colors don’t mean much, and whatever color your hat is depends on personal preferences.</p>\n<p>For hot summer days, you’ll be better off wearing a hat that’s a light color, so that most of the sun’s rays will reflect off your head. This will help cool your overall body temperature. In contrast, black hats absorb the most heat, inevitably warming you up the more sun you get.</p>\n<p>Now, when it comes to cowboy hat <em>behavior</em>, there are a few unspoken rules you might be expected to follow. For example, if you’re attending church for any reason, take your hat <em>off</em> while inside the building.</p>\n<p>If you live in the US, it’s considered respectful to also remove your hat during the Pledge of Allegiance, Passing of the Flag or during the National Anthem. In some areas, it’s polite for men to take their cowboy hats off (or simply tip them) when introducing themselves to a lady.</p>\n<p>It’s also considered good manners to place your cowboy hat upside down whenever you take it off. The origins of this practice might be practical in nature, as placing it that way will prevent the <a href=\"https://gamingsection.net/news/what-do-cowboy-hat-colors-mean-3/\">brim from flattening</a> and help maintain the hats' original shape.</p>\n<h2><strong>What does a black cowboy hat symbolize? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>In short, it can represent evil.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apparelsearch.com/terms/b/black_hat.html\">Traditional western films</a> used white cowboy hats for good guys, while black cowboy hats were worn by the baddies. Even today's media has used the black cowboy hat to emphasize the evilness of just about any antagonist. Other popular bad guys such as Darth Vader and the Wicked Witch of the West also wore black headwear to represent their badness.</p>\n<p>This isn’t to say you’ll become a villain in the eyes of others should you decide to wear one. In fact, the black cowboy hat is the <a href=\"https://gamingsection.net/news/what-do-cowboy-hat-colors-mean-3/\">most popular</a> of its kind for both ladies and men.</p>\n<h2><strong>Should you wear brown boots with a black cowboy hat? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>You don’t have to, but the combination will work!</strong></p>\n<p>Either a black or white cowboy hat will match with just about any other color. If you want to rock a black hat and brown boots combo, go for it.</p>\n<p>With that being said, it’s usually a good idea to avoid bright colors for your boots and other accessories such as your tie. You want <em>some</em> contrast, but anything too stark such as wearing bright red boots with your black cowboy hat will raise eyebrows.</p>\n<h2><strong>Who should consider wearing brown boots with a black cowboy hat? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Anyone! </strong></p>\n<p>Unless the dress code at a formal gathering states otherwise, anyone can pull off brown boots and a black cowboy hat combination. The dark colors simply work well together in just about any setting.</p>\n<p>However, for any event that has no western elements to speak of, it might be better to leave your hat and boots at home in favor of something else. You want to dress to impress. That’s understandable, but it also matters if you dress appropriately for the occasion.</p>\n<h2><strong>Does cowboy hat color matter? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>It depends on certain holidays and what else you wear.</strong></p>\n<p>As discussed before, the color can affect your body temperature depending on the season. Practicality aside, you can wear just about any cowboy hat color you choose, but pulling off a good look can become much harder the more western you want to appear.</p>\n<p>In some cases, it’s more appropriate to wear <a href=\"https://gamingsection.net/news/what-do-cowboy-hat-colors-mean/\">white straw</a> cowboy hats during Memorial Day through Labor Day. You’ll also fit in better if you wear a hat that corresponds to the color of your favorite sports team during a game.</p>\n<p>When wearing other western-style clothes with your hat, the general rule of thumb is to compliment it with similar colors. Black cowboy hats will look better with darker colors, and vice versa when considering lighter colors. Remember the word <em>compliment</em>, meaning you want your outfit to stand out, but not too much (think bright neon colors or something equally weird).</p>\n<h2><strong>Does a cowboy hat have to match the boots? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Not really, but it would be a good idea. </strong></p>\n<p>A black cowboy hat will go well with black cowboy boots, or even a brown pair. What’s more important, however, is the <em>theme</em> you’re trying to achieve. If you’re wearing a cowboy hat of any color in public, others <a href=\"https://www.seniorcare2share.com/does-cowboy-hat-have-to-match-boots/\">will expect</a> to see you wearing a slick pair of cowboy boots to match. These two items tend to go together like bread and butter, it’s simply how the get-up has come to be.</p>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>Cowboy etiquette can be important, but something even more crucial is matching your cowboy hat with appropriate colors and style. Aim to be admired, not mocked.</p>",

            "content_html": "<h2>Cowboy Boots With Tuxedos  </h2>\n<p>An important event is coming up.</p>\n<p>You hear that formal wear is expected. Your mind starts racing with all kinds of clothes that you can choose.</p>\n<p>There’s a nice tuxedo hanging in your closet, and a pair of cowboy boots to match.</p>\n<p>Although, is pairing the two a good idea? In this article, we’ll take a look at the finer details of a tuxedo and boot combination, the dos and don’ts of wearing them, and some alternatives in the odd case that the attire you have in mind simply won’t work.</p>\n<h2><strong>Should you wear cowboy boots while wearing a tuxedo? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>It depends on where you’re going.</strong></p>\n<p>If the host of the event makes a strict note to <em>not</em> wear cowboy boots and/or a tuxedo, then choose another kind of outfit all-together. The question, however, is not so much if you<em> should</em> wear the combo or not, but if you can pull it off in the first place.</p>\n<p>Generally, Tuxedos are known to be a special type of formal wear that require specific kinds of shoes. Anything from classy Oxfords to <a href=\"https://bespokeunit.com/suits/tuxedos/shoes/\">Calvin Klein Bernards</a> are considered more appropriate matches for tuxedo suits. This isn’t to say that you <em>can’t</em> wear cowboy boots at all when rocking a tux, just know that other kinds of footwear might be more appropriate depending on the event you’re attending.</p>\n<p>If you want to try the tux and cowboy boot combination anyway, the number one thing you should avoid is bright colors, especially if certain accessories are in contrast to one another. For example, if your tuxedo is black, <em>don’t</em> pair it with bright red boots. Instead, have your footwear match your suit. Black boots, especially polished to a sleek glossy shine, will pair best with a black tuxedo.</p>\n<p>If it’s available near you, the best match for cowboy boots is the famous <a href=\"https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-western-tuxedo/\">western tuxedo</a>.</p>\n<p>Prominent figures such as former US President George Bush Sr. were known to rock this combination in public.</p>\n<p>To do this yourself, it’s important to take a detailed look at what’s considered the full western tuxedo appearance. In addition to your cowboy boots, you may also need a black cowboy hat and an over-sized belt buckle.</p>\n<p>Also, putting on a pair of \"boot-cut\" jeans on top of all that wouldn’t be a bad idea either. If the western appearance is your ideal go-to, then it doesn’t hurt to go all out with it.</p>\n<p>However, this get-up might not be appropriate for all formal gatherings. However, if you live in the southern US or a similar area, then don’t worry about wearing a tux and cowboy boots.</p>\n<h2><strong>When should you consider wearing cowboy boots with a tuxedo? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Location, location, location. </strong></p>\n<p>This will sound like a repeated piece of advice, but <em>where</em> the event is being held can make all the difference in what you pick to wear. If the event you’re attending is a formal wedding, and it has no western themes to speak of, then it’s best that you pick other kinds of footwear other than cowboy boots.</p>\n<p>Another example would be attending a fancy ball. The cultural clash of western and classy gala won’t mix well, and you’ll be getting the wrong kind of attention. If necessary, study the local fashion of where you’ll be going. You’re dressing to impress after all.</p>\n<p>However, if you’re in <a href=\"https://rmkshoes.com/can-you-wear-cowboy-boots-with-a-suit/\">Texas</a> or anywhere similar, then wearing both the tux and boots might be <em>expected</em>. For formal events in these areas, it’s common to have a <a href=\"https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/western-tuxedo-etiquette/\">\"black tie and boots\"</a> dress code.</p>\n<p>Remember the earlier advice recommending you avoid using bright colors? Well, it can matter, especially with men wearing slick tuxedos and polished cowboy boots. That’s right, these kinds of events expect your boots to shine like a brand-new mirror. So, regardless of which cowboy boots you pick to wear, give them a solid cleaning and polish before you head out.</p>\n<h2><strong>What brand of boots goes well with a black tuxedo? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>There are many types, but the more important thing is giving your footwear a clean look.</strong></p>\n<p>To be even more specific, polish your boots so well that you can see your face in them better than in your bathroom mirror. For any small scratches, you might be able to use <a href=\"https://bespokeunit.com/suits/tuxedos/shoes/\">shoe cream</a> as a quick-fix, but if your footwear is made of other materials besides calfskin, it’ll be much harder to buff out any unsightly marks.</p>\n<p>To compliment the tuxedo look, especially a western-style, consider getting a pair of boots made from <a href=\"https://rmkshoes.com/can-you-wear-cowboy-boots-with-a-suit/\">cowhide, caiman, or lizard</a>. Bonus points if you can find any in glossy black.</p>\n<p>It’s also recommended that you avoid using any brown cowboy boots. The reasoning goes back to when we talked about the need to avoid bright colors. The exception in this case would be pairing them with a nice brown tuxedo to match. What we’re trying to avoid are things that contrast and stand out to one another. It’s better if you match the tux and boot colors.</p>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>So, as a quick recap, don’t ignore the possibility that you’ll need different footwear altogether, avoid bright colors, and match your boots with whatever tux you decide on using. Accessories such as a tie should match the boots and suit as well.</p>\n<p>Whatever you choose, keep a clean appearance. Don’t be afraid to add a bit of extra polish and elbow grease as well.</p>",

            "content_html": "<h1>Do pants go over or under cowboy boots?</h1>\n<p><strong>It depends on the type of pants you are wearing as well as the gender of the person. Does this sound a bit confusing? Then keep reading this article. We will explain this topic in detail and clarify the mystery behind it.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Can men wear their pants tucked into their cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>The fashion experts say no, they cannot. Men typically wear wide-legged pants such as jeans or slacks. Those would look rather silly tucked into cowboy boots. </strong></p>\n<p>Then there is the practicality aspect of it. Most jobs require men to be on the go a lot. When their pants are crammed into their cowboy boots it makes it difficult to move around. So, they are best off not doing it.</p>\n<p>One last point is that constantly jamming the pants inside the boots can ruin them. Slacks, suit pants, or even jeans can become permanently creased or worn around the spot of the calves. You certainly don't want this to happen, right?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Can women do it?</h2>\n<p><strong>Women have more choices than men when it comes to tucking their pants into their boots. Many women wear leggings, tight-fitting jeans, or spandex-style pants which hug the lower legs. Pants such as these are meant to be tucked into a sweet pair of cowboy boots.</strong></p>\n<p>There are times when the same woman will wear pants that are loose at the bottom. Examples of these would be bell-bottoms, loose-fitting jeans, slacks, or pantsuit bottoms. She has a choice of tucking the pants into the boots or letting them hang loose. Either is considered fashionable by style experts.</p>\n<p>With women, the occasion plays a role in the answer. For a more formal occasion, she is better off letting the pants hang down over the boots. If she is riding a horse, a bicycle, a motorcycle, or moving around a lot, it is prudent to tuck the pants smoothly down into the boots.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Can kids wear their pants over their cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>When they are involved in an activity, we would say no, do not. They are always running around or participating in some kind of sport. When doing so, the kids are more apt to trip over them and get hurt. During this time, it is best to tuck the pants into their cowboy boots.</strong></p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you want them to look proper for school, religious services, or a visit with the grandparents, they can wear their pants over the boots. Especially if they are a dressier type of pants. Like women, kids have many options; sometimes with the assistance of their parents.</p>\n<p>One great thing about being a kid wearing cowboy boots is they can get away with things that adults cannot. One of those things is the concept of wearing pants over their pants. Who knows? The child could be much more comfortable that way.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>When do you put cowboy boots under your pants?</h2>\n<p><strong>Traditionally, it is anytime you are attending a formal occasion. It could be a business meeting, a fancy dinner party, perhaps even a wedding. At such events it is frowned upon to wear your pants inside your cowboy boots. </strong></p>\n<p>As we discussed earlier, another time to do so is when you are working at a particularly active job. It is highly uncomfortable to have your pants bunched up inside the cowboy boots when moving around. Who wants to walk around like that anyhow?</p>\n<p>Although you want room between the boots and your legs, you really don't want them to appear baggy. Pants look best when they are form-fitted and not sticking up out of your cowboy boots.</p>\n<h2> </h2>\n<h2>Should you be putting cowboy boots underneath jeans?</h2>\n<p><strong>What many people do is buy their jeans specifically to wear with their cowboy boots.

If you care what people think of your attire and accessories, you will want to read this.</p>\n<h2>Can you wear dress cowboy boots with a suit?</h2>\n<p>Many years ago the answer to this question would have been absolutely not. But, this is 2022. Society has changed and so has the ever-changing world of fashion. Today it is perfectly acceptable to wear cowboy boots with a man's suit or slacks, a woman's pantsuit, skirt or dress.</p>\n<p>Does the style of the boots matter? In a sense, yes. The pair of boots you want to wear depends on the look you are trying to achieve. If you are wearing a casual outfit, the cowboy boots can be casual.

Therefore, your cowboy boots ought to mirror your suit.</p>\n<h2>When should you wear dress cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p>It totally depends on the outfit you are wearing as well as the occasion. Not every style of dress cowboy boots will go with every suit. As we discussed in the previous paragraph, the boots ought to compliment the suit. For example, you would not wear thick winter boots with a lightweight dressy, formal suit.</p>\n<p>Another instance would be the reverse. If it is cold outside, and you are wearing a heavy clad suit, then your thick winter boots will be fine. The occasion has something to do with it too. If it is a special occasion, and you are wearing an appropriately-styled suit, then your dress cowboy boots should compliment it. That goes for the color of your attire as well.</p>\n<h2>What cowboy boots go good with suits?</h2>\n<p>Ideally you ought to own many pairs of cowboy boots, one pair for every purpose that arises. Some should be dressy, some casual, others good for working or driving in. They also need to come in many colors, including at least one pair in black, one in brown, and one in tan.</p>\n<p>That said, once again times have changed. A couple of decades ago, cowboy boots only came in a few designs, colors, and thicknesses. In today's marketplace there have to be literally hundreds of choices. It is up to you to select pairs that you love and are comfortable to wear. Additionally, it is best if you try them on before you buy them.

They can wear dressy cowgirl boots with their business and formal attire. The boots need to compliment the outfit she is wearing. It is feasible to wear dressy boots with pantsuits, short dresses, and short skirt with a top combination.</p>\n<p>Are there exceptions? Yes, if she is wearing a long dress or skirt it would probably look silly to wear cowboy boots with that. This is true even if the boots are a dressy pair. In that case, she really needs a different type of footwear. Other than that, it is up to the individual whether to wear dressy boots with her outfit.</p>\n<h2>Can you wear cowboy boots with slacks?</h2>\n<p>It is doable, yes.
