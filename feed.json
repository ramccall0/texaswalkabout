            "content_html": "<p><strong>There are some folks who suggest wearing cowboy boots with jeans in the cab of a big rig all day is highly uncomfortable. Those folks are obviously stuck back in the old days when cowboy boots were originally made. These statements are no longer true.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In today's world it is possible to buy models of jeans AND cowboy boots that are very comfortable to wear all day. The focus of this article is the comfort factor and other related subtopics of cowboy boots worn by truck drivers. Please read all the way until the end.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Why do truck drivers prefer cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p>There are some people who adorn different footwear for different purposes. They might wear certain shoes to work, other shoes to go out at night with, and perhaps really fancy shoes for that special occasion. We all know those people, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Truck drivers are not able to do this. Their footwear must be multi-functional. This is where cowboy boots come into play. If they purchased the right model for themselves in the first place, that one pair of boots is perfect for all those occasions we just mentioned.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Does this article only apply to men?</h2>\n<p><strong>No, it applies to all genders. Although it may still be rare, there are some women truck drivers. The same reasons why men truck drivers like cowboy boots can apply to women's cowgirl boots.</strong></p>\n<p>There are hundreds of varieties of cowgirl boots that a woman can wear and be comfortable all the time. This includes if she drives a truck. So, if you are a woman, you should pay attention to this article. Ladies, you can enjoy your boots!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Cowboy boots offer unequaled foot protection too</h2>\n<p><strong>What? What are we talking about? A person's feet must be protected from extreme temperatures, both cold and hot. Additionally, they do not want wet feet from rain or snow. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Again, truck drivers do not have the luxury of carrying footwear for each purpose. In all cases, cowboy boots will protect a truck driver's feet from these things. One perfect pair of boots is all he or she needs to bring along.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Are cowboy boots comfortable to wear during long drives?</h2>\n<p><strong>Again, it depends on the model of cowboy boots you buy. When people think of cowboy boots, they envision long pointed toes, slippery soles, and higher heels. Boots like that do exist, but they are not your only options.</strong></p>\n<p>In today's market it is plausible to buy several pairs that are more comfortable. Yet they are definitely still cowboy boots. These models of cowboy boots are stylish and very slick-looking, but are more practical choices for truckers or anyone that drives a lot. Be sure to allow for a break-in period before using them for work.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Are cowboy boots DOT approved for truck drivers' footwear?</h2>\n<p><strong>The DOT regulations state that any driver who operates a commercial vehicle on a public highway must wear shoes. They also are not permitted to remove their shoes while in operation mode. There is nothing that states cowboy boots are not allowed to be worn.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Common sense should prevail here!</h2>\n<p><strong>While there is no law against wearing cowboy boots from the US DOT, common sense should prevail. Cowboy boots do not magically appear on your feet, you must buy them. Common sense also dictates you try the boots on before buying them. Keep trying on various pairs until you find that perfect pair for truck driving. Then buy two or three of those. This will avoid not having the right boots at any one time.</strong></p>\n<p>You ought to know if you will be wearing them while driving long distances in a big rig. Therefore, YOU must determine if they will be comfortable enough for you. If there is any doubt in your mind, do not buy that pair. With so many choices in today's marketplace, you need not buy boots that are not comfortable, right? Right!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p><strong>Sure, you can wear cowboy boots while driving a large truck. But, is it a good idea? As we have been discussing, it is a fantastic idea as long as you buy the right models. When you enter the western boot store, tell the sales associate you want pairs that are suitable for your occupation. He or she should be able to direct you to the correct section.</strong></p>\n<p>Keep in mind, you need not give up style in order to receive practicality. With so many makes and models of boots available, it is completely possible to buy and wear cowboy boots that are comfortable for truckers!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>They do if they fit properly. The majority of the time, when a person's western boots hurt their ankles and foot arches, it is because they don't fit correctly. There is a reason for trying things on before you buy them. This reason applies to cowboy boots as well. Want to know more? Keep reading this article.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Why do my cowboy boots hurt my ankles?</h2>\n<p><strong>Your ankles as well as foot arches will hurt if the boots do not fit you correctly. It is the same with any type of footwear. </strong>If you already know your foot size, you can possibly get away without trying them on first. However, you are still taking a massive risk that your cowboy boots will not fit well.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Having a perfect fit is the key</h2>\n<p><strong>When a person buys western boots for the first time, the fit is the key to whether they keep them and buy more pairs. If the boots do not fit well, he or she may be permanently turned off to them. This scenario can be avoided if they try on the boots and make sure they are comfortable at the outset.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Take a little time now, avoid a lot of problems!</h2>\n<p><strong>You wouldn't buy clothing without trying it on first, right? It is the same with cowboy boots. If you feel like you don't have the time to try on endless pairs until you are comfortable, do not buy the boots at all. Your ankles and arches are an important part of your body. Isn't it worth some extra time to get the right fit of boots?</strong></p>\n<p>If they do not fit you correctly, the leather inside the boots will rub up against your ankles constantly. Additionally, the inside bottoms of the boots won't be supporting your arches. Thus, they will also hurt.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>This is not something you must just get used to</h2>\n<p><strong>The wrong size boot is not hard to avoid. All you have to do is try on the boots first.</strong> Remember too, each make and model of boots will be different. Along with that comes different fits for your feet. Even if you know your correct shoe size, it really is prudent to try them on properly.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>How can your cowboy boots hurt your ankles?</h2>\n<p><strong>Think of how you looked forward to owning a stylish pair of cowboy boots. Aren't they simply beautiful? Why would you carelessly choose the wrong boots? This makes all the difference on how you view wearing western boots. Do yourself a huge favor and try on as many pairs as you need until you get the correct ones.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Break-in period is always needed</h2>\n<p><strong>This is something many people forget. Even when you purchase that perfect pair of boots, you could have sore feet for a while. This is due to the break-in period. Footwear is especially needy when you first get it. It takes a considerable amount of time until the boots feel comfortable. That is the nature of footwear! </strong></p>\n<p>Your western boot store sales person should be able to give you pertinent tips on how to break in your new boots. For the best results, follow those tips exactly. After that, the boots ought to fit perfectly all the time. Do this with each new pair of any type of footwear, not only boots.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Is it normal for cowboy boots to hurt at first?</h2>\n<p><strong>Yes, this is normal with cowboy boots or any other types of shoes, as we have been discussing. For that matter, a new piece of clothing might hurt your body at first. Any type of garment needs a break-in period. That is just the way of the world as far as clothing and accessories go. </strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Your body is constantly changing</h2>\n<p><strong>Why is this relevant? Because a pair of cowboy boots or any other type of clothing may not fit so well after a while. You might be puzzled as to why. More than likely, it is because your body has changed. You now need to adjust the size you buy. This is another reason why you must try on the boots or any other garment before you buy them. </strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p><strong>The main question of this article is will your cowboy boots provide ankle support. The answer is YES, as long as you buy the appropriate size. The only way to ensure that is to try on various sizes and styles of boots before you buy them. If you follow this cardinal rule, you will enjoy wearing your western boots for many years to come!</strong></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>They most certainly do! Between the high-quality leather they are constructed with and the comfortable inner lining, cowboy boots just scream warmth. This is exactly what you need on those cold crisp days, whether or not you are actually a cowboy! Want to know more? Keep on reading this article!</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Can you wear cowboy boots in the winter?</h2>\n<p>If it is just cold temperatures, then yes cowboy boots are fine. They do best when they are kept away from rain and snow. Although they are water-resistant, they are not waterproof. This means prolonged exposure to wet precipitation can make the leather crack.</p>\n<p><strong>On the other hand, cowboy boots can insulate your feet in rain and snow and keep them warm and dry. If you use products made to extend the life of the leather, then you can wear them in wet conditions. Just be aware that you might need to replace them more frequently than if you avoid water. </strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Examples of people who wear cowboy boots during winter</h2>\n<p><strong>There are several to speak of. You can be sure these people wear their boots all year long. Mind you, the following list presents merely some examples.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cowboys/cowgirls</li>\n<li>Ranch hands</li>\n<li>Truck drivers</li>\n<li>People who ride horses often</li>\n<li>People who live in cold weather climates</li>\n<li>People who work on farms or in barns</li>\n<li>Rodeo workers</li>\n<li>Rodeo participants</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Buy the right type of boots to begin with</h2>\n<p><strong>One key to having your cowboy boots survive cold, wet weather is to buy the right ones in the first place. Back when cowboy boots were new this would not have been possible. However, today many manufacturers make models that are much better in wet, icy conditions. These boots will stand up to the trials they undergo.</strong></p>\n<p>Ideally, you should own many pairs of cowboy boots. Types to include are those meant for standing up to extraordinary amounts of water as well as your boots can also work well for dressy occasions.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>How do you keep your feet warm inside cowboy boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>First, make sure you have at least one pair that is lined on the inside. Some models of cowboy boots are lined and some are not. Check the insides of the boots before you buy them to be certain they are lined. Your feet will be toasty warm inside your lined cowboy boots.</strong></p>\n<p>The other thing you can do is wear warm socks inside your boots. Your feet will sweat even in icy cold weather. Wearing socks will help protect your sweaty feet from becoming cold and frost-bitten. It is possible to buy ultra-warm socks made for harsh cold temperatures. Then your feet will stay warm inside your cowboy boots.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Are cowboy boots good for heat?</h2>\n<p>Here is the opposite scenario from what we have been discussing. Are cowboy boots good to wear in the heat? It might seem like a silly idea to do that. But consider this. People who regularly wear cowboy boots do so all year round, even in hot weather. Why? Keep reading!</p>\n<p><strong>We spoke of how cowboy boots will protect your feet from harsh cold winter weather. They will also protect your feet from the scorching hot summer temperatures and direct sunlight. </strong></p>\n<p>In the case of summer heat, you would probably not want to wear models that have a warm lining. Instead, you would opt for plain, unlined cowboy boots. Fortunately nowadays, they come in many varieties, so there is at least one appropriate pair for every season.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p><strong>Back in the early days of cowboy boots they were really only made with the idea of showing them off at fine social gatherings. Today, there have to be at least a few hundred different pairs of all styles and qualities. This means you can buy some that are perfect for extreme cold as well as other models that are great for extreme heat.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If you just want to look stylish at that fancy gala you are going to, there are still cowboy boots on the market for that. There is no limit on how many pairs you can own. Buy as many as you like and have a great time wearing them!</strong></p>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>No matter where we go, we can’t but help wanting to look good in front of others. Wearing the right cowboy boots and jeans are no exception. You’ve heard of the classic Levis 501 jeans, but are they a good match for western-style footwear? In this article, we’ll discuss the answer to that question and more!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Can you wear cowboy boots with Levis 501 jeans? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>That’s a resounding yes!</strong></p>\n<p>Made of 100% cotton, Levis 501 jeans are a <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/best-levis-for-cowboy-boots/\">good match</a> for cowboy boots. Sporting extra thigh room, you won’t have many problems fitting this brand of jeans over your footwear.</p>\n<p>There’s even a “sit-at-waist type” you can get if your job requires constant lifting of heavy loads. Even if you’re standing up and sitting down all day long, your 501 Levis won’t let you down.</p>\n<p>One disadvantage, however, that these particular jeans have is the need to break into them. A fresh pair of Levis 501 will feel very stiff at first, but will adjust to your body shape the more you wear them.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Should you wear cowboy boots with Levis 501 jeans? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>That’s entirely up to you.</strong></p>\n<p>First off, keep in mind that there’s a <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/best-levis-for-cowboy-boots/\">huge selection</a> of jeans you can pair your cowboy boots with. It’s not a matter of one-size-fits-all. A good idea would be to find some jeans that feel comfortable to wear. Don’t pick something out for style alone. Remember, <em>you’re</em> the one who’s going to be wearing them!</p>\n<p>In his review, YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHk26s3oz90\">Jeremiah Craig</a> tries out a fresh pair of Levis 501 with multiple types of boots. These jeans will work very well with just about any cowboy boot, but he warns viewers to beware wearing Levis 501 with ropers and a wide square toe. This is because of how these cowboy boots have very wide tops, and may not fit right underneath the jeans.</p>\n<p>Another piece of advice he leaves viewers with is that Levis 501 might not work if you’re too skinny. As the leggings flare out a bit, a skinny person might find themselves wearing an un-pleasant baggy look.</p>\n<p>Just to be safe, if you’re going with the 501 model, stick with cowboy boots that have narrower tops to avoid a weird look. You want to look good, not have your jeans stretch out too much, especially around the legs.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What jeans work with cowboy boots? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Wide/Relaxed Fit, Regular/Straight Leg, and Boot-Cut.</strong></p>\n<p>What we’re focused on here is not brand name, but jean type. You’ll want a pair that <a href=\"https://www.ariat.com/al/how-to-wear-cowboy-boots-and-jeans-men\">fits around your boots</a>. Jeans such as the boot-cut variety flare around the legs, allowing more space to tuck cowboy boots into.</p>\n<p>Levis 501 can work as well, as long as the tops of your boots aren’t too wide. If you’re not going to buy a slimmer pair of cowboy boots in the near future, then try out either boot-cut or wide/relaxed fit jeans. What works well will check your boxes for both style <em>and</em> comfort.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Do cowboys still wear Levis? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>They sure do!</strong></p>\n<p>The real deal, does in fact, still wear Levis jeans. They’re especially useful when materials such as <a href=\"https://horseracingsense.com/what-kind-of-jeans-cowboys-wear/\">lycra and elastane</a> are added to their cotton construction. This allows more flexibility, especially for rough horse rides or rugged ranch work.</p>\n<p>However, even though Levis jeans are worn by actual cowboys, many prefer <a href=\"https://horseracingsense.com/what-kind-of-jeans-cowboys-wear/\">Wranglers</a> over anything else. They simply find them tougher for the jobs they need to do. Even if they can be incredibly stiff to wear, Wranglers are known to protect modern cowboys from cold winter temperatures.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Are Levi’s 501 still fashionable? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>They are, but you might want to stick with a classic look for the best results.</strong></p>\n<p>Ever since their inception in <a href=\"https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/levis-jeans-review/\">1873</a>, Levis 501 jeans have been used by miners and cowboys alike. Even today, these types of jeans are used for rough work just about everywhere.</p>\n<p>You can still achieve a nice stylish look with them, but you’ll need to pair these jeans with “classic” pieces of clothing that go with them. Levis has kept their 501 model mostly the same for over a century, and doesn’t plan to change that anytime soon.</p>\n<p>With that being said, it would be harder to achieve a more “modern” look with a pair of Levis 501. They’re not made for fancy dress and the latest fashions, so stick with more classic styles of attire.</p>\n<p>To help you achieve this, find some 501 jeans that come in medium-blue or <a href=\"https://horseracingsense.com/what-kind-of-jeans-cowboys-wear/\">charcoal-wash</a>, especially if you’re going for that classy western look. The color could matter more than any other accessories you pick!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>So to recap, a pair of 501 Levis jeans will work <em>great</em> with many types of cowboy boots. They do, however, come with some drawbacks like being stiff to wear, or will not accommodate boots with wider tops.</p>\n<p>Your overall body shape will factor in as well. Being too large and muscular or very skinny means a 501 pair might not be the best. Remember, there are <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/best-levis-for-cowboy-boots/\">many</a> different pairs of jeans you can pick from, so you’re far from being out of options.</p>\n<p>The best way to find out is to try out a pair yourself. You won’t know for certain if these jeans will work or not until you’ve paired them with your cowboy boots inside a store. Now that you have a little more knowledge than before, start exploring!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Wearing cowboy boots is a fashion statement. Whether you’re a guy or gal, you want to look your best while wearing this iconic western-style footwear. You hear that Levis is a good brand of jeans to pair with. Yet, is that true? In this article, we’ll discuss the answer to that question and more!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What are the best Levis to wear with cowboy boots? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>For 2022, there are 20 types to choose from.</strong></p>\n<p>This year there’s a huge selection of Levis for men and women <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/best-levis-for-cowboy-boots/\">both</a>. Some types include Levi’s 501, 505, and 541.</p>\n<p>Before the 1900s, Levis were considered “pants for the poor,” and were generally not favored by real cowboys. However, not long after, people began preferring the “rugged” kind of Levi jeans, such as straight-leg or boot-cut. These types allow the wearer to fit cowboy boots underneath the jean leggings.</p>\n<p>With that being said, there is no real “best” kind of Levis to wear. It depends on your body type and what type of cowboy boots you want to pair with jeans. For example, the Levi’s Men’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=Levi%27s+Men%27s+513+Slim+Straight+Jean&amp;linkCode=gs3&amp;tag=fromthegues0f-20\">Slim Straight Jean</a> isn’t ideal for cowboy boots with extra-wide shafts. A pair of boot-cut jeans would work better in those circumstances.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What can you wear with cowboy boots and jeans? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Keep it simple, unless you’re Texan.</strong></p>\n<p>Unless you plan to work on a ranch very soon, the rule of thumb is to stick with <a href=\"https://www.artofmanliness.com/style/shoes/cowboy-boots/\">one western-themed</a> piece of clothing with your cowboy boots and jeans. Unless you want people to immediately think “Cowboy” when they see you, try to keep your attire casual.</p>\n<p>Clothing like plain collared shirts or decorative belt buckles are known to pair well with just about any jean and cowboy boots combination. A couple of things to avoid for casual cowboy boot wearers are cowboy hats and spurs.</p>\n<p>However, depending on the scene you’ll be showing off in, such as a big city or rural area, dress appropriately for your environment.</p>\n<p>For cities, it’s better if your outfit appears more “dressier” than someone who’s about to go to a rodeo. Out in the country, feel free to wear more than one piece of western-themed clothing, especially in states such as Texas.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What Levis do cowboys wear? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Actually, real cowboys wear Wranglers!</strong></p>\n<p>According to one <a href=\"https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/levis-vs-wrangler-best-cowboy-jeans\">Texas journalist</a>, it’s much better to wear a tough pair of Wrangler jeans around the real deal. Those folk consider others who wear Levis “drugstore cowboys,” and won’t be getting complimented anytime soon.</p>\n<p>This isn’t just a brand preference in itself. Real cowboys use the “barbed-wire test” with their jeans. They claim that a pair of Wrangler jeans won’t rip on barbed-wire, whereas a pair of Levis will.</p>\n<p>However, it shouldn’t really matter which brand you go with. Both Wrangler and Levis can work with cowboy boots if you choose the right accessories to go with them.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What cut of jeans should I wear with cowboy boots? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Boot-Cut, Wide/Relaxed Fit, and Regular/Straight Leg.</strong></p>\n<p>It’s not so much a matter of whether you <em>should</em> or not, but what feels the <a href=\"https://www.ariat.com/al/how-to-wear-cowboy-boots-and-jeans-men\">most comfortable</a>. As mentioned earlier, you’ll need enough pant-leg space to work with just about any pair of cowboy boots out there.</p>\n<p>A quick way to tell what <em>doesn’t</em> work is if you can’t slip your jeans over the boots in the first place. Experts recommend avoiding <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/best-levis-for-cowboy-boots/\">slim jeans</a>, for both men and women. These are different from <em>skinny</em> jeans, which can work when tucking the legs into cowboy boots.</p>\n<p>If your boots are very wide at the shafts, consider getting boot-cut jeans. As the name implies, these jeans are designed to accommodate most boots.</p>\n<p>Regular/straight leg and wide/relaxed fit are okay as well, but you might have to put in a little extra effort to fit those jeans together with your cowboy boots. Again, pick out whatever combination feels comfortable to wear.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>How should pants be worn with cowboy boots? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>In general, keep the boots tucked inside your jeans.</strong></p>\n<p>Unless you’re doing <a href=\"https://www.ariat.com/al/how-to-wear-cowboy-boots-and-jeans-men\">heavy-duty work</a>, a good rule of thumb is to keep your jean legs on the outside. Folks who tuck their jeans into their boots usually do so for <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/best-levis-for-cowboy-boots/\">safety purposes</a>.</p>\n<p>When riding a horse, cowboys will tuck in their jeans so they don’t get caught on anything while riding. This is especially important when getting in and out of the saddle.</p>\n<p>And for those working in rough outdoor conditions, avoid wearing baggy jeans. In fact, most rugged jobs will consider doing so unsafe!</p>\n<p>Otherwise, cowboy boots look better when you cover the shafts up with your jeans. Unless you plan to go full western, keep those boots tucked in.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>Remember, there is no “best” pair of Levis that will pair well with your cowboy boots. As we come in all shapes and sizes, so do the clothes we wear. Exercise careful judgement and pick out what works best for <em>you</em>.</p>\n<p>Also, be aware of the environment you’ll be wearing your combination in. Styles can vary greatly when comparing people who live in the country with those dwelling in big inner cities.</p>\n<p>Style is important, but won’t mean much if you’re uncomfortable in the clothing you wear. A pair of boot-cut jeans might work for the other person, but you may find them unbearable. It helps to try on several pairs of jeans and cowboy boots to find the right fit.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><strong>Foot odor can be a real problem, especially when you're on your feet all day. Will wearing cowboy boots give you smelly feet? If your boots stink, what can you do? Do you have to wear socks? Will wearing cowboy boots cause other foot problems?</strong></p>\n<p>If you have questions about foot odor and cowboy boots, you'll find the answers you need below. Sweaty feet can be an issue when you wear boots, but thankfully, there are plenty of ways to prevent and deal with this problem.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Do Cowboy Boots Make Your Feet Stink?</h2>\n<p><strong>Cowboy boots won't always make your feet smell, but they can make your feet sweaty, which can lead to foot odor. This can be an issue with any type of closed shoe. Sweat is less likely to be a problem if you choose shoes made from natural, breathable materials, like leather boots with a fabric lining.</strong></p>\n<p>You can also reduce issues with sweat by wearing absorbent, moisture-wicking socks beneath your boots. Make sure that your boots fit you properly; ventilation can be an issue with tight boots. Choose comfortable boots that give your feet plenty of room to breathe.</p>\n<p>When you take your boots off at the end of the day, you should give them a chance to dry. You can place your boots next to a dehumidifier or invest in a boot dryer. Drying out your boots can evaporate sweat inside them, which can keep odor-causing bacteria from spreading.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>How Do You Get the Smell out of Cowboy Boots?</h2>\n<p><strong>If your cowboy boots already smell like sweaty feet, you can neutralize the odor by sprinkling a handful of baking soda in each boot. Let the boots sit overnight, and then shake out the baking soda. It can absorb odor-causing molecules, leaving your boots smelling fresh again.</strong></p>\n<p>If you don't have baking soda on hand, you can do the same thing with dryer sheets. Right after you remove your boots, line them with dryer sheets and let them sit for at least 12 hours. If you put the dryer sheets inside your boots while they're still warm, they'll be able to absorb more sweat.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Is It Okay to Wear Cowboy Boots Without Socks?</h2>\n<p><strong>You can wear cowboy boots without socks, but your feet will be more likely to sweat. One way to counteract this is to put moisture-wicking insoles inside your boots. The insoles will absorb some of the moisture from your feet, reducing sweat and odor.</strong></p>\n<p>Remember that not all insoles are created alike; gel insoles could actually cause your feet to sweat more. Only use absorbent insoles, and change them out as soon as you start to notice an odor. With the right insoles, you can skip socks and minimize foot sweat.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Is Wearing Cowboy Boots Good for Your Feet?</h2>\n<p><strong>Cowboy boots can be great for your feet, but it's important to remember that not all boots are the same. High-quality leather boots can keep your feet comfortable and provide support throughout the day. Cheap boots made from faux leather, on the other hand, won't let your boots breathe.</strong></p>\n<p>If you wear cowboy boots on a regular basis, it's worthwhile to invest in a pair of well-made boots that meet your needs. Look for leather with a heel between 1 and 1.5 inches. A boot with a higher heel could put pressure on your knees and interfere with your walking stride.</p>\n<p>Have your feet and calves measured before buying boots to make sure that your boots aren't too tight. If your boots are too tight to bend at the calf, it could cause muscular pain. Once you find the right boots, take the time to break them in before you wear them for long stretches of time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p><strong>Cowboy boots can cause your feet to sweat, which can cause foot odor. Thankfully, odor is less likely to be an issue with breathable leather boots. Moisture-wicking socks and insoles can also help to minimize sweating and bad smells. </strong></p>\n<p>If your boots still wind up smelling, you can take care of the odor with a little baking soda or dryer sheets. It's normal for feet to sweat, but with a few precautions, you can keep your feet from stinking up your favorite pair of cowboy boots.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>You’re thinking of getting a new pair of stylish cowboy boots. However, how the heck do you tell which pair is the right size? Can they be worn with jeans? In this article, we’ll answer those questions and more.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What's the ideal leg opening size for cowboy boots? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>About 20 and ¼ inches.</strong></p>\n<p>Even if you have the right leg opening, keep in mind that there are <a href=\"https://horseracingsense.com/wearing-mens-cowboy-boots-with-jeans/\">certain</a> ways you should consider when wearing jeans with cowboy boots. One thing you should avoid doing most of the time is tucking jeans into your boots, unless you’re working on the ranch or riding a horse and don’t want your pants to get too dirty.</p>\n<p>A highly recommended approach is to wear jeans over the boots, so that most of the shafts are covered. Some brands that work best for this are Ariat and Wranglers.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind the length of your jeans as well. You don’t want them too short or too long. If the pant legs are longer than you’d expect, then you run the risk of stepping on them with your boots. If too short, it will just look weird.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>How do you measure cowboy boot size? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Measure your feet in the store, or draw the length of each foot.</strong></p>\n<p>The easiest way would be to use a Brannock device, a tool that most footwear retailers use to determine a customer’s foot size. However, if you want to measure before heading out to the nearest boot store, consult this <a href=\"https://stageswest.com/blog/cowboy-boot-sizing-guide/\">sizing guide</a> to figure out which size works best for you.</p>\n<p>If you find out that you’re between sizes, it’s a good idea to go with the larger one when selecting a new pair of cowboy boots. Having a bit of extra room is always a nice thing to have, because you never know how much your feet can grow!</p>\n<p>Another thing, measure your feet at least once per year. Even if you have another pair of boots that you can get your size from, your feet won’t remain the same size for long, so measure them just in case.</p>\n<p>One other tip is to wear socks for measurements. Doing so can add ½ a size to your feet, and will get you closer to getting the right pair of boots.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>How much room should you have in cowboy boots? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Experts recommend leaving about 1/8<sup>th</sup> of an inch for the heel lift.</strong></p>\n<p>To be more specific, “heel lift” is the <a href=\"https://www.ariat.com/al/how-to-fit-cowboy-boots\">gap</a> between your heel and the insole of the boot you’re interested in. To achieve this, put a boot on, and then lift your heel up before measuring the gap with your fingers.</p>\n<p>Another thing to be aware of when sizing boots is to check for any extra room in the toe box. With the boot on, use a sideways thumb to see if it fits between the boot tip and your toes.</p>\n<p>Also, make sure the ball of your foot, the widest part of it, aligns with the boot’s outsole. The boots should feel snug, and not too tight.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Can you wear straight-leg jeans with cowboy boots? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Yep!</strong></p>\n<p>You can also wear <a href=\"https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-wear-boots-with-jeans#4-types-of-jeans-to-wear-with-boots\">other</a> kinds of jeans with cowboy boots too! However, guys may want to avoid wearing skinny jeans with their boots, as this fashion choice is more acceptable for gals.</p>\n<p>When it comes to style, don’t forget about choosing a nice color either. Usually darker colors pair well with cowboy boots.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>How should cowboy boots fit around my leg? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Make sure your calves are comfortable.</strong></p>\n<p>When considering the right size, it’s important to find out how a boot feels around your <a href=\"https://www.deephollowranch.com/how-should-cowboy-boot-fit/\">calf</a>. This should be immediately apparent once you slip the boot on. If you encounter too much resistance, that boot is too small for you.</p>\n<p>Don’t forget about your feet! If you put on an ideal pair of cowboy boots and are still unsure, walk around in them to see how they feel. Test out how the balls of your feet bend, and if your toes have a bit of extra space to move around in.</p>\n<p>Remember, you’ll have to break into most pairs of cowboy boots, and you need comfort (the right size!) to do so. Take your time and try things out.</p>\n<p>If it feels like your ankles are flying around inside, then that boot is too large. As cowboy boots don’t use laces, it’s all the more important that you can easily slip into them, and keep them on while you walk around.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>How are cowboy boots supposed to fit around the shin? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Again, find out how your calves feel in boots.</strong></p>\n<p>Your shins aren’t the ideal thing to focus on when sizing. It’s easier to gauge how boots fit around your legs by testing how much room your calves have.</p>\n<p>Try to leave a half-inch up to <a href=\"https://bootspy.com/how-should-cowboy-boots-fit/\">two inches</a> of space between your calves and the boot shafts. As long as your ankles don’t feel too loose when wearing cowboy boots, then a bit of extra space around the legs should be fine.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>When getting <em>any</em> new footwear, it’s important to know what size fits you best. Doing so will allow a much more comfortable experience, especially with leather cowboy boots.</p>\n<p>This is also important when matching them with a pair of jeans. Take your time to pick a pair that compliments the boots, and feels comfortable to wear.</p>",

In this article, we’ll discuss whether you should or shouldn’t wear them while hunting, and what you can do to protect your feet from just about any hunting activity.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Are cowboy boots good for hunting? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>No, not really.</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, cowboy boots won’t serve you well in the wilderness when hunting game. This is due to their <a href=\"https://dresscodehub.com/wear-cowboy-boots-hunting/\">intended design</a>, which does not include protecting your feet from long hunts.</p>\n<p>The two major disadvantages cowboy boots have are their lack of grip on the outer soles and poor ankle support. This can be especially problematic if you choose to hunt off the beaten trail.</p>\n<p>Heavily wooded areas or desert can become incredibly slippery during or after a rain. Cowboy boots won’t help you with this, they’re simply not designed for any of that.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Should you wear cowboy boots while hunting? </strong></h2>\n<p><strong>You can, but it’s generally not a good idea.</strong></p>\n<p>Even though there are various hunting <a href=\"https://dsgouterwear.com/blog/blaze-orange-hunting-requirements-by-state-usa/\">rules</a> in the US that all hunters must abide by, there’s virtually nothing saying you can’t wear cowboy boots on a hunt if you want to. Therefore, it’s your choice.</p>\n<p>Some people have recommended using <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/I-live-in-the-Appalachian-region-and-I-hunt-Are-cowgirl-western-boots-good-for-hunting-in-mountains-especially-walking-around-a-lot-trailing-outside-dogs\">roper-style</a> cowboy boots over traditional ones, due to their <a href=\"https://www.westernbootbarn.com.au/blog/the-history-of-cowboy-boots/\">lower</a> heel heights. Just in case, make sure any ropers you’re interested in also come with good grip.</p>\n<p>The primary subject here, however, is that it’s a better idea to wear boots for their intended <a href=\"https://www.idahostatejournal.com/outdoors/xtreme_idaho/yes-you-do-need-different-boots-for-different-activities/article_08fe4796-8969-5b24-bd43-35fbe20bd88f.html\">purposes</a>. Going for a hike? Hiking boots. Going on a hunt? Hunting boots, especially for colder weather.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the choice is yours, but don’t ignore your safety, either. You might be out in the wild for several hours on end. At the very least, cowboy boots can <em>technically</em> work if you walk on open trails, places that aren’t usually affected all too much by weather. Use careful judgement.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>What boots do you wear for hunting? Boots for hunting. </strong></h2>\n<p>Hunting boots are used for hunting. Many are <a href=\"https://protips.dickssportinggoods.com/sports-and-activities/hunt-and-fish/learn-about-different-types-of-hunting-boots\">specially</a> designed for colder weather, have cleats in addition to heavy rubber grip, high ankles to protect the legs from bites and sharp brush, and insulating layers for sitting still on long winter hunts.</p>\n<p>However, be warned, they have a little extra <a href=\"https://decideoutside.com/hiking-boots-vs-hunting-boots/\">mass</a> than most outdoor shoes and boots.

Yep!</strong></h2>\n<p>Ever since their <a href=\"https://www.westernbootbarn.com.au/blog/the-history-of-cowboy-boots/\">inception</a>, cowboy boots have been used to ride horses comfortably and keep their riders secure. From their earlier usage as Spanish horse boots in the 1600s to the modern ones we know of, cowboy boots are also now used for ranching and farming.</p>\n<p>But with it also came a style that people simply enjoy wearing, such as in the 40’s, when the pointed-toed cowboy boot became an American icon. So what’s the purpose of a cowboy boot? Just about anything you want it to be!</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Are hunting boots necessary? No, not really. </strong></h2>\n<p>Due to how <a href=\"https://decideoutside.com/hiking-boots-vs-hunting-boots/\">safe</a> it is, sticking to the trails in just about any footwear is game. As long as they have <em>some</em> support, like insulating your feet from the cold, then pick any kind of footwear you want!</p>\n<p>Remember that piece of advice earlier, the one about hunting boots having more <a href=\"https://decideoutside.com/hiking-boots-vs-hunting-boots/\">mass</a>? That will add to cost in addition to the extra protection you’ll be getting.</p>\n<p>However, most hunts in general would likely involve some off-terrain traveling. Wearing cowboy boots in the thick muck or woods would get you a sprain sooner than getting your target.</p>\n<p>Let’s not forget about <a href=\"https://dresscodehub.com/wear-cowboy-boots-hunting/\">safety</a>. Harming yourself in the middle of nowhere means you won’t get help for quite a while. Cowboy boots <em>may</em> protect you from a snake bite, but an actual snake boot will do the job better. Use an intended boot for an intended purpose. Can you be a cowboy in the thick wilderness? Not without a horse!</p>\n<p>All in all, you’re your own boss. We’re just discussing what’s best for <em>you</em> in addition to what you prefer.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>Hunting doesn’t always have to be extreme, but with extreme terrain, <a href=\"https://dresscodehub.com/wear-cowboy-boots-hunting/\">hunting</a> boots are best for hunting.</p>\n<p>How long you hunt has a part to play in it too. Perhaps bring another pair of boots with you? Even if your cowboy boots break or can’t get you to where you need to go, then at least you have something extra that you can swap with. Having a variety of tools and tricks will help just about any hunter. Especially when hunting some difficult game.</p>\n<p>Want to go for cowboy boots anyway? By all means!

This isn’t to discourage anyone from trying, but cowboy boots with extra support can make all the difference.</p>\n<p>Regardless of your choices, be prepared for <em>any</em> hunt you decide to go on. Check the weather. Will it be slippery after that storm? Is the area on a steep mountain ridge? Was there a flood on the plains last night? If things get wild, then it’s a good idea to leave any cowboy boots at home.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>You have a pair of cowboy boots that you want to slip on for a long journey on the road, but is doing so a good idea? In this article, we’ll discuss the pros and cons of choosing to get behind the wheel with cowboy boots on your feet.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Can you get into the driver's cabin in cowboy boots? Yes you can!</strong></h2>\n<p>There’s <a href=\"https://www.motorbiscuit.com/illegal-wear-high-heels-while-driving/\">no law</a> in the US saying you <em>can’t</em> drive in boots that have heels on them, so if that’s your wish, then go ahead! However, the positioning of your feet around the pedals might be a bit awkward, so exercise caution before starting up your vehicle.</p>\n<p>One idea you could try is testing your boots to see how they contact the pedals. Of course, make sure your engine is off and the vehicle is in park before you do this. If nothing feels weird or unsafe to you, then it should be safe to drive with cowboy boots on.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Should you drive while wearing cowboy boots? That’s up to you, but consider some tips before hitting the road.</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite no law barring the use of cowboy boots while driving, many driving experts advise <a href=\"https://www.motorbiscuit.com/what-not-wear-driving-car/\">against</a> wearing them when you’re behind the wheel.</p>\n<p>The reason is that certain footwear reduces the ability for your feet to feel the pedals. The thicker the soles, the harder it is to know if your foot is, in fact, on the brake pedal or not.</p>\n<p>Highheels and wedges are the worst for driving. Cowboy boots usually fit into that heel category. The higher the heel on your pair of boots, the riskier it gets.</p>\n<p>However, this doesn’t mean it’s completely unsafe to drive with that slick pair of boots you own. In fact, there are a few <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/can-you-drive-in-cowboy-boots/\">advantages</a> that come with wearing cowboy boots while driving. You can depend on better toe protection than other simpler kinds of footwear, and seeing how <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/how-long-do-cowboy-boots-last/\">durable</a> cowboy boots are, you can expect to drive in that pair for many years to come.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>How do you go driving in cowboy boots? Carefully.</strong></h2>\n<p>Yes, there are some advantages when it comes to cowboy boots and driving, but keep in mind the warnings too.</p>\n<p>For example, even though the toes can protect you from impact damage, constantly applying the break and gas can <a href=\"https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/can-you-drive-in-cowboy-boots/\">wear down</a> your feet and legs in a hurry.</p>\n<p>This applies to narrow toe boxes, so to avoid this issue, pick a pair of boots with more toe room. The last thing you want while riding down the road is to have your feet seize up from cramps and pain.</p>\n<p>For those driving under three hours per trip, issues such as narrow toe boxes and a lack of proper foot support shouldn’t be much of an issue.</p>\n<p>However, for those who will be behind the wheel for hours on end, grab some gel pads in addition to selecting a pair of cowboy boots that will give your toes more space to feel and operate.</p>\n<p>To sum things up, it’s not so much <em>how</em> you drive in boots, it’s <em>what</em> you decide to wear for long trips. Any of the above risks are not guaranteed to happen, but the longer you drive in cowboy boots, the more likely you’ll experience discomfort and pain. Plan ahead before getting in the driver’s seat.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Which shoes are best for driving? Something that’s flat and allows your feet to feel the pedals better.</strong></h2>\n<p>Shoes that are a good bet for driving include <a href=\"https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-driving-shoes\">thin soles</a> that allow the driver to better feel which pedal is which. One of the best soles to look out for is a “pebbled” one, allowing just about any person to feel what’s underneath.</p>\n<p>Some examples of these shoes include loafers, moccasins, and Uggs. Various kinds of sneakers and specialized <a href=\"https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-driving-shoes\">racing boots</a> can work well too.</p>\n<p>However, these kinds of footwear aren’t mandatory, just highly recommended for long periods of driving. Cowboy boots can do the job as well, just as long as you consider the state of your feet and how they behave on long road trips.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Can I pull off cowboy boots? You can with the right outfit.</strong></h2>\n<p>Wearing cowboy boots means you’re making a statement. Whether it’s for style, your cultural background, or simply wanting to try something interesting, people <em>will</em> notice your boots once you step out of the driver’s seat.</p>\n<p>A good piece of advice to consider is selecting a nice pair of <a href=\"https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-driving-shoes\">jeans</a> that can match your cowboy boots. Pairs like boot-cut jeans will match your boots in a stylish way. To achieve a more modern look, pick some jeans in dark blue or even charcoal wash.</p>\n<p>Also, let’s not forget about cowboy boots. If you’re going for appearance, check out this handy <a href=\"https://www.ariat.com/al/cowboy-boot-styles\">style-guide</a> to help you achieve the best look.</p>\n<p>For heavy duty jobs like cargo truck driving and construction, seriously consider getting a pair of <a href=\"https://www.ariat.com/mens-cowboy-boots?sz=24\">work</a> cowboy boots. Remember that bit earlier about toe protection? Most work boots these days have steel toes in them, which will keep your feet safe from harm.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n<p>There’s no one particular way to drive perfectly in cowboy boots. Everyone has different feet and preferences in how long they drive.</p>\n<p>The biggest thing, however, to consider is how <em>comfortable</em> your feet are in cowboy boots. You won’t drive in anything <em>un</em>comfortable, so pick something that will prevent that.</p>",
