The majority of the time, when a person's western boots hurt their ankles and foot arches, it is because they don't fit correctly. There is a reason for trying things on before you buy them. This reason applies to cowboy boots as well. Want to know more? Keep reading this article.</strong></p><hr><h2>Why do my cowboy boots hurt my ankles?</h2><p><strong>Your ankles as well as foot arches will hurt if the boots do not fit you correctly. It is the same with any type of footwear. </strong>If you already know your foot size, you can possibly get away without trying them on first. However, you are still taking a massive risk that your cowboy boots will not fit well.</p><hr><h2>Having a perfect fit is the key</h2><p><strong>When a person buys western boots for the first time, the fit is the key to whether they keep them and buy more pairs. If the boots do not fit well, he or she may be permanently turned off to them. This scenario can be avoided if they try on the boots and make sure they are comfortable at the outset.</strong></p><hr><h2>Take a little time now, avoid a lot of problems!</h2><p><strong>You wouldn't buy clothing without trying it on first, right? It is the same with cowboy boots. If you feel like you don't have the time to try on endless pairs until you are comfortable, do not buy the boots at all. Your ankles and arches are an important part of your body. Isn't it worth some extra time to get the right fit of boots?</strong></p><p>If they do not fit you correctly, the leather inside the boots will rub up against your ankles constantly. Additionally, the inside bottoms of the boots won't be supporting your arches. Thus, they will also hurt.</p><hr><h2>This is not something you must just get used to</h2><p><strong>The wrong size boot is not hard to avoid. All you have to do is try on the boots first.</strong> Remember too, each make and model of boots will be different. Along with that comes different fits for your feet. Even if you know your correct shoe size, it really is prudent to try them on properly.</p><hr><h2>How can your cowboy boots hurt your ankles?</h2><p><strong>Think of how you looked forward to owning a stylish pair of cowboy boots. Aren't they simply beautiful? Why would you carelessly choose the wrong boots? This makes all the difference on how you view wearing western boots. Do yourself a huge favor and try on as many pairs as you need until you get the correct ones.</strong></p><hr><h2>Break-in period is always needed</h2><p><strong>This is something many people forget. Even when you purchase that perfect pair of boots, you could have sore feet for a while. This is due to the break-in period. Footwear is especially needy when you first get it. It takes a considerable amount of time until the boots feel comfortable. That is the nature of footwear!</strong></p><p>Your western boot store sales person should be able to give you pertinent tips on how to break in your new boots. For the best results, follow those tips exactly. After that, the boots ought to fit perfectly all the time. Do this with each new pair of any type of footwear, not only boots.</p><hr><h2>Is it normal for cowboy boots to hurt at first?</h2><p><strong>Yes, this is normal with cowboy boots or any other types of shoes, as we have been discussing. For that matter, a new piece of clothing might hurt your body at first. Any type of garment needs a break-in period. That is just the way of the world as far as clothing and accessories go.</strong></p><hr><h2>Your body is constantly changing</h2><p><strong>Why is this relevant? Because a pair of cowboy boots or any other type of clothing may not fit so well after a while. You might be puzzled as to why. More than likely, it is because your body has changed. You now need to adjust the size you buy. This is another reason why you must try on the boots or any other garment before you buy them.</strong></p><hr><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p><strong>The main question of this article is will your cowboy boots provide ankle support. The answer is YES, as long as you buy the appropriate size. The only way to ensure that is to try on various sizes and styles of boots before you buy them. If you follow this cardinal rule, you will enjoy wearing your western boots for many years to come!</strong></p></div><aside class="post__sidebar post__sidebar--left"><div class="sidebar sidebar--sticky"><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Share on:</h3><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fdo-cowboy-boots-provide-ankle-support-explained%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fdo-cowboy-boots-provide-ankle-support-explained%2F&amp;via=Texas%20Walkabout&amp;text=Do%20cowboy%20boots%20provide%20ankle%20support%3F%C2%A0%20(Explained)" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fdo-cowboy-boots-provide-ankle-support-explained%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=Do%20cowboy%20boots%20provide%20ankle%20support%3F%C2%A0%20(Explained)" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pinterest </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fdo-cowboy-boots-provide-ankle-support-explained%2F" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mix </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fdo-cowboy-boots-provide-ankle-support-explained%2F" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Do%20cowboy%20boots%20provide%20ankle%20support%3F%C2%A0%20(Explained)&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fdo-cowboy-boots-provide-ankle-support-explained%2F" class="js-share buffer" title="Share with Buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Buffer </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Do%20cowboy%20boots%20provide%20ankle%20support%3F%C2%A0%20(Explained) https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fdo-cowboy-boots-provide-ankle-support-explained%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp</a></div></section><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Tagged in:</h3><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/" title="Cowboy Boots">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/" title="Western Wear">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div></section><nav class="sidebar__item post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Previous post:</h3><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/can-you-wear-cowboy-boots-in-vegas-clubs/" rel="next">Can you wear cowboy boots in vegas clubs?
