One thing you can do is purchase your boots specifically to match your hat. Bring your hat along with you when you visit the boot store.</strong> Then you can be sure they will go together perfectly. Will you be arrested if they do not match? No, of course not. This is merely a fashion suggestion. Let us explore this topic.</p><hr><h2>Can you wear a cowboy hat without cowboy boots?</h2><p><strong>Technically doing this is a fashion faux pas. Style experts say wearing sneakers or ordinary shoes with a cowboy hat is not good. </strong>According to them, wearing them with anything other than cowboy boots looks silly.</p><p>Keep in mind that, along with the boots, the rest of your outfit should be the same style. Wear an appropriate shirt and pants with your cowboy hat and boots. Otherwise, why bother to add just the boots? What will happen to you if you ignore this advice? Absolutely nothing!</p><hr><h2>Is it considered disrespectful to wear a cowboy hat?</h2><p><strong>In theory, if you are not a cowboy and have never even been on a horse, the answer is yes.</strong> In this case, it is disrespectful to the folks that do this. However, this is 2022 and things have changed. Nowadays, many people wear cowboy hats and boots who truthfully should not.</p><p>Word to the wise though. If you are dressed like this and stroll into a cowboy bar, be prepared to face some guff. There are some people who will take offense to this. If you do not care about this, go ahead and wear the cowboy hat and boots!</p><hr><h2>How to match your cowboy hat to the boots</h2><p><strong>Let's take the color black which is the most versatile one. It is nearly impossible to find a hat and boots that are exactly the same shade of black. What you want to do is come as close as possible. This holds true of your belt too. Ideally you ought to select a hat, boots, and a belt that are the same basic colors.</strong></p><p>The rest of your outfit should be a contrasting color. You really do not want to wear attire that is all the same color. What you can do is keep these style guidelines in mind when you are purchasing the pieces to your outfit. Trust us, you will look very dashing.</p><hr><h2>What about women wearing a hat with cowgirl boots?</h2><p><strong>The same fashion rules are true for the ladies. A woman should wear similarly colored boots with her hat. If she wears a belt, that ought to match up as well.</strong></p><p>Some people will tell you not to wear fringe, sequins, or rhinestone outfits with your hat and boots. We take the opposite view. If you have ever observed participants in a western-themed parade, you will see this all the time. They look smashingly great doing so. Go ahead and wear them!</p><hr><h2>What is the cowboy hat rule?</h2><p><strong>We have been discussing this throughout our blog. </strong>The rule actually is, if you are not an authentic cowboy or cowgirl, you should not be wearing such attire. There are people who will be offended by it and could act aggressively towards those who violate this rule.</p><p>The flip side is, rules are meant to be broken. New fashion trends are always emerging. If you decide you want to wear a cowboy hat and matching boots, who is going to stop you? You might be part of the newest fashion revolution and inspire others to follow suit.</p><hr><h2>What color should my cowboy hat be?</h2><p><strong>It can be any color you choose. If you love cowboy hats, why stop at one? You can own several of them, each a different color. </strong>Then have a pair of boots that go with each hat. The rest of your attire looks best if the colors compliment that hat and boots.</p><p>There are certain colors associated with special occasions. For example, a black cowboy hat with finely-stitched black western boots is appropriate to wear to dressy events. It is best if you find out the rules of etiquette when wearing the hat. You want to know when it can be on your head and when you must remove it.</p><hr><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>As we stated earlier, fashion rules like these are someone else's opinion on how you should look. When it comes right down to it, you ought to wear what you want. There is no wrong opinion. A person needs to feel comfortable with their attire, no matter what items they wear.</p><p>Do you want to wear a cowboy hat with boots? Then go right ahead! We are willing to bet you receive a wealth of compliments. It is your life, enjoy what you choose to adorn your body with!</p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
