They are extremely slippery. Believe it or not there is a terrific reason for this. We shall explain. Please read all the way through.</strong></p><hr><h2>The main reason cowboy boots are designed to be slippery</h2><p><strong>Because so many people who wear cowboy boots ride horses, the boots are made slippery on purpose. Horses can be unpredictable. They can rear up or take off running unexpectedly, dragging the rider. Then they can also accidentally fall and land on top of the rider.</strong></p><p><strong>If the rider's feet were to get trapped in the stirrups, he or she could get seriously injured or even pass away. Because the soles of the cowboy boots are slippery, they will automatically fall out of the stirrup when the need arises. Thus, the rider does not get trapped on the horse, disaster is avoided. There is your reason cowboy boots are slippery</strong></p><hr><h2>What about those people who wear cowboy boots that never ride horses?</h2><p>There are measures you can take to make your boots less slippery. They include buying pairs that have less slippery soles. These days there are models of cowboy boots available that fit the bill. The rest of this article will focus on these points. Make sure to read it all the way until its end.</p><hr><h1>Models of cowboy boots with good traction</h1><p><strong>See, they do exist!

So, what are some models you can buy for these purposes? Here is a brief list.</p><ul><li>Tecovas Men's Cowboy Boots</li><li>Lucchese Men's Square Toe Boots</li><li>Men's Groundbreaker Work Boots</li><li>Lucchese Lewis Boots</li><li>Lucchese Welted Western Boots</li><li>Men's Circuit Patriot Western Boots</li><li>Cuero - The Eastwood Men's Cowboy Boots</li><li>Dan Post Waterproof Albuquerque Leather Boots</li></ul><hr><h2>Should you try to put grip on cowboy boots?</h2><p>The remainder of this article will focus on those customers who prefer traditional-looking cowboy boots. We shall begin by answering the above question. <strong>That depends on how often you wear them and for what purposes. </strong>If you feel you would benefit from making your boots less slippery, by all means, do it.</p><hr><h2>How can you accomplish this feat?</h2><p><strong>You can start by adding a grainy textured mixture to the soles of your cowboy boots. It is possible to concoct a solution of salt and rubber glue.</strong> Apply this mixture to the bottom of your soles and allow them to dry for about a half hour. Instructions can be found on the Internet, for example on the site where you found this article.</p><hr><h2>Is there such thing as traction spray for cowboy boots?</h2><p><strong>Yes, there are commercial brands of traction spray that you can buy. </strong>You would likely find it at any store where you can buy the boots themselves. Examples are Boot Barn and Cowtown Cowboy Outfitters. Walmart also carries the traction spray.</p><p>Traction spray can even be purchased online. Any source from whence you buy cowboy boot products including the ever-reliable Amazon.com and Walmart.com. Grainger.com also carries cowboy boot traction spray. There are scores of options available.</p><hr><h2>What are some signs your cowboy boots are worn down?</h2><p><strong>Keep in mind that, when properly cared for, cowboy boots can last for decades.</strong> The soles of your cowboy boots are constructed to be slippery for the reasons we previously described. Therefore, that is not a sign that the boots are too worn out.</p><p>It is possible to step on a nail or piece of glass and accidentally puncture a hole in the soles. You will know if this has happened because rain water or sand from messy pavement will seep in. Other than something like that occurring, you should not need to worry about worn out cowboy boot soles.</p><hr><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p><strong>With the hundreds of models of cowboy boots on the market nowadays, you should have at least one pair for every purpose to wear them. This ought to include a few with rubber soles.</strong> <strong>You would wear these when you do not expect to be on a horse and your local environmental conditions call for them.</strong></p><p>Alas, we cannot tell you what to do; we can only suggest. If you insist on buying only cowboy boots with slippery soles, you can follow our advice of how to maneuver in them. Like we said, it is possible to make those boots less slippery. So, go ahead and enjoy the cowboy boots! You deserve them!</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
