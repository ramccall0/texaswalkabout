Traditionally worn by cowboys, it is a type of riding boot with a high heel, made from stacked leather, and forms into a pointed toe with a high shaft and no lacing.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowboy boots are a very versatile style of shoe that can easily be dressed up by pairing it with a sports coat or blazer or dressed down for a more casual look. These boots can be worn during any season. The boots come in a range of colors that pair well with most outfits.</span></p><p> </p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sports coat with jeans and cowboy boots</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowboy boots can be paired with jeans and a sports coat provided that the sports coat is made of more textured fabric such as flannel. Both cowboy boots and denim have a casual yet rustic appeal that marries well with a textured sports coat.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea behind this combination is that the fabrics need to complement each other well and balance each other out in order for the look to work. Most sports jackets or suit jackets come in fine worsted wool fabric which appears more sleek and polished as opposed to casual.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, traditional sports coats are more tailored, which is in contrast to the bulky appearance of the boots. Always pair a classic style with quality materials.</span></p><p> </p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you wear cowboy boots with a blazer?</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pair cowboy boots with a blazer when planning a night out on the town. This is a classic smart-casual look when paired correctly. Dark denim jeans, a solid colored shirt, and a dark blazer look chic and stylish. Keep in mind that the color of the belt should match with the color of the boots.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solid colors have a different appeal when paired together. Combining earth tones for a smart-casual outfit will create a look that is effortlessly chic and stylish.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider shades such as deep navy, tan, creamy white, white, charcoal gray, deep green, or even black will all pair beautifully with the right shade of cowboy boots. A simple rule is never to pair cowboy boots with a full suit. While this can be done, it leans more toward eccentric rather than chic.</span></p><p> </p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should you wear cowboy boots with a sports coat?</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowboy boots can and should be worn with a sports coat. The sports coat should be made of textured material to balance out the outfit. The coat should also be tailored and fitted. It should not sit too loose or too tight. The correct fit for the coat is just below the rear.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, polished, plain boots work best for this attire. In addition, an oxford cloth button-down collar shirt complements the attire well. As previously mentioned, the color of the boots and belt should match.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, be cognizant of the fact that certain colors do not pair well together, such as black and brown. Brown can be paired with both cooler and warmer tones, such as navy blue, gray, white, or tan, while black pairs with most colors on the color palette, including charcoal gray, white, tan, burgundy, or even navy blue.</span></p><p> </p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">When should you consider wearing boots with a sports coat?</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wear boots with a sports coat for any event that calls for smart casual attire. Sports coats are generally more casual than blazers. The smart casual dress code is a balance between casual wear and more formal attire. Pair boots with a sports coat for a business casual or smart-casual event. This pairing is ideal for social occasions that have a professional flare.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowboy boots are rustic and casual, while a sports coat leans more towards smart casual. The great thing about textured material sports coats is the variety of patterns and materials that these coats come in.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From textured material such as flannel, corduroy, velvet, or wool to different patterns such as herringbone, plaid, windowpane, tartan, etc. there are endless possibilities of combinations that will work very well together.</span></p><p> </p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you wear a sport coat with jeans?</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a technique to make this combination work well. Firstly, both the denim and the coat should be fitted. Secondly, the denim should be more formal, such as dark blue denim, while the coat should be more casual. Thirdly, the two items should not be identical in color but the materials should complement each other well.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's so easy to get this paring wrong. All too often, the outfit may sit entirely too loose, the combination of denim and coat look too similar in color and texture, or the denim is too casual for the coat.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best denim for this outfit should be well-fitted, clear, and dark. For the coat, steer clear of blazers that are smooth in material and appear more formal. You may want to opt for a more rustic and casual coat.</span></p><p> </p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the best sport coat to wear with jeans?</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A casual sports coat made from thicker material is ideal to wear with denim. The color of the coat should contrast with the color of the denim and should preferably have two buttons as opposed to three. It should be fitted with unstructured and softened shoulders.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, steer clear of monochromatic colors when pairing a sports coat with denim. There should be a stark color contrast between the two items of clothing.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the material of the sports coat should be textured and casual.</span></p><p> </p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final thoughts</span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some simple and basic rules when wearing cowboy boots with a sports coat or blazer. The shoes are more casual, therefore the jacket should match the style of the shoe. This can be achieved through the type of material and/or pattern on the coat/blazer/jacket, and other features such as the number of buttons, shoulder design, and the fit of the coat/blazer/jacket.</span></p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
