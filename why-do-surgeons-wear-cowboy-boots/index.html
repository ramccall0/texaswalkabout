That slick leather-made footwear. Cowboy boots are worn by all kinds of people everywhere. Yet, do some professions allow them? What if that person were a surgeon? In this article, we’ll discuss the answer to that question and more!</p><hr><h2><strong>Why do surgeons wear cowboy boots? Some say they’re highly functional.</strong></h2><p>When your job requires you to stand for hours on end, you’ll need some serious support for your feet. One <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/do-your-feet-a-favor-wear-cowboy-boots/273223/">surgeon</a> claims that his cowboy boots give him “a built-in heel lift” that reduces stress on his Achilles tendon. Not only that, cowboy boots can also give surgeons overall “solid support” because of rigid metal shanks within the soles.</p><p>In this case, surgeons need footwear that won’t cause them problems later on in the day. It’s also recommended that any surgeon shopping for cowboy boots get a pair that has <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/do-your-feet-a-favor-wear-cowboy-boots/273223/">more room in the toe box</a> like a rounded or square toe.</p><p>The material that cowboy boots are made of can also factor in to the wearer’s overall comfortability. Some materials like ostrich leather are more “forgiving” towards those who suffer from bunions.</p><hr><h2><strong>Do doctors wear cowboy boots? Yes they do.</strong></h2><p>One doctor describes how his pair of cowboy boots <a href="https://www.quora.com/Can-surgeons-wear-any-shoes">protect his feet</a> from all the gore and guts that comes with surgery. Most surgeons are required to wear something that is waterproof so they don’t risk contaminating their feet with someone else’s bodily fluids.</p><p>Whereas not exactly waterproof, cowboy boots are highly <a href="https://horseracingsense.com/cowboy-boots-waterproof-leather-snow/">water resistant</a> and can take a bit of punishment. However, it's not recommended that the wearer expose the boots to things like snow and excessive moisture too often, lest the leather on the boots crack and dry.</p><p>With that being said, there are certain <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=mink+oil+for+leather&amp;linkCode=gs3&amp;linkId=14aca1efebe9d0f444342d27cd2da62a&amp;tag=horseracing04-20&amp;ref=as_li_ss_tl">products</a> one can get to make cowboy boots even more water resistant. They don’t seem that expensive either, as anyone wanting to strengthen their footwear can buy things like mink oil for just over $10.</p><p>For the most part, surgeons and other kinds of medical doctors can wear any kind of footwear they please, as long as they follow proper sterile procedures. When delivering babies, for example, doctors are required to slip on <a href="https://www.quora.com/Can-surgeons-wear-any-shoes">disposable waterproof boots</a> over whatever shoes or boots they’re wearing at the time.</p><hr><h2><strong>What is the purpose of wearing cowboy boots? Function <em>and</em> style.</strong></h2><p>Ever since the late 1800s, cowboy boots have been used extensively by common folk. One of the <a href="https://stageswest.com/blog/benefits-of-wearing-cowboy-boots/">earliest innovations</a> of the cowboy boots, the toe shape, was made in such a way that it easily allows the wearer to get boots in and out of stirrups.</p><p>And that gift keeps on giving. The cowboy boot design also allows the wearer to remain firm within the stirrups while riding a horse. Also, the tough leather cowboy boots are made to protect the wearer from bushes, cacti, thorns, branches, and snakes!</p><p>Even today, cowboy boots are used for the same purposes. They’re also quite comfortable to wear, especially if the wearer gets them properly fitted. And seeing how they don’t use laces, anyone can slip them on and off at their leisure, as well as keep them on for long periods of time without the worry of any laces coming undone.</p><hr><h2><strong>What shoes do surgeons wear during surgery?</strong></h2><p><strong>They can wear just about anything they want. However, some shoes serve their purposes better than others.</strong></p><p>As we’ve established already, cowboy boots may not be the best kind of footwear for surgeons due to the need for waterproofing around their feet. Shoes such as <a href="https://testprepnerds.com/mcat/best-shoes-surgeons/">Crocs</a> are preferred for the operating room due to their slip resistance.</p><p>And like cowboy boots, doctors who do surgery often prefer something that they can easily slip on and off, like a pair of clogs, for example. Whereas certain kinds of shoes (with laces) are worn by surgeons as well, it’s much more convenient to slip your feet in and forget them before an important job.</p><p>Another feature surgeons look out for is <a href="https://testprepnerds.com/mcat/best-shoes-surgeons/">protection</a> against sharp objects, cold, and impact injuries to their feet. Some OR rooms can be uncomfortably chilly, and standing still in this environment can sap away all the feet warmth.</p><hr><h2><strong>Are cowboy boots comfortable to wear for long periods of time? They can be.</strong></h2><p>This is where a potential owner of cowboy boots should look out for function over style. This is because shopping for <a href="https://horseracingsense.com/are-cowboy-boots-comfortable/">style alone</a> can leave the wearer disappointed (and possibly injured!). The key here is, take your time when browsing around for this iconic kind of footwear. Chances are that you’ll have your new boots for a long time to come. Cowboy boots, if properly taken care of, can last for <a href="https://stageswest.com/blog/benefits-of-wearing-cowboy-boots/">years on end</a>.</p><p>Even if you find the right pair for you, you’ll still need to <a href="https://horseracingsense.com/how-break-in-ariat-leather-cowboy-boots/">break into them</a> so that they mold to the shape of your feet. This process is made much easier when you obtain a pair that actually fits. One way to speed up the process even further is using <a href="https://horseracingsense.com/how-break-in-ariat-leather-cowboy-boots/">steam</a> to soften the leather, making it relaxed enough to mold over a short period of time.</p><hr><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>Keep in mind that even though surgeons like to wear cowboy boots at work, you don’t need to be a medical doctor to enjoy their full benefits. As we’ve surmised, cowboy boots are tough, comfortable, and stylish enough for just about any job out there.</p></div><aside class="post__sidebar post__sidebar--left"><div class="sidebar sidebar--sticky"><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Share on:</h3><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhy-do-surgeons-wear-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhy-do-surgeons-wear-cowboy-boots%2F&amp;via=Texas%20Walkabout&amp;text=Why%20do%20surgeons%20wear%20cowboy%20boots%3F%20(Explained)" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhy-do-surgeons-wear-cowboy-boots%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=Why%20do%20surgeons%20wear%20cowboy%20boots%3F%20(Explained)" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pinterest </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhy-do-surgeons-wear-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mix </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhy-do-surgeons-wear-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Why%20do%20surgeons%20wear%20cowboy%20boots%3F%20(Explained)&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhy-do-surgeons-wear-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share buffer" title="Share with Buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Buffer </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Why%20do%20surgeons%20wear%20cowboy%20boots%3F%20(Explained) https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhy-do-surgeons-wear-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp</a></div></section><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Tagged in:</h3><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/" title="Cowboy Boots">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/" title="Western Wear">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div></section><nav class="sidebar__item post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Previous post:</h3><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/suede-vs-leather-cowboy-boots/" rel="next">Suede vs leather cowboy boots (Explained)</a></div></nav></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__author"><div><h3 class="h6"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/authors/texas-walkabout/" rel="author">Texas Walkabout</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><div class="post__related"><h3>Related post</h3><div class="l-grid"><article class="c-card c-card--compact"><div class="c-card__body"><header><h2 class="c-card__title c-card__title--compact"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/sports-coat-with-jeans-and-cowboy-boots/">7 Tips For Wearing A Sports Coat With Jeans And Cowboy Boots </a></h2></header><div class="metadata c-card__metadata c-card__metadata--compact"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/" class="metadata__maintag">Cowboy Boots</a> <a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/authors/texas-walkabout/" class="metadata__author">Texas Walkabout</a> <time datetime="2022-03-06T11:20" class="metadata__date">03.06.2022</time></div></div></article><article class="c-card c-card--compact"><div class="c-card__body"><header><h2 class="c-card__title c-card__title--compact"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/do-pants-go-over-or-under-cowboy-boots/">Do pants go over or under cowboy boots?
