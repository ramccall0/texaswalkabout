An unfortunate feature of cowboy boots sometimes is announcing the wearer’s entrance into a room through loud squeaking. At first, this sound might not bother you (or those around you) too much. However, this sound can wear on even the most patient western boot wearer.</p><p class="p1">Luckily for you, we have the answer for why cowboy boots might be loud and how to fix them. To summarize, cowboy boots are loud sometimes because the soles have become unattached. If this is not the case, it might be because the pair of cowboy boots is new; the outsoles have become tacky and stick to the floor, making a sound as they come unstuck; the leather is old or stiff, causing it to be loud as it moves; or perhaps the problem is inside the boot, related to the insoles.</p><hr><h2 class="p2"><strong>Why are my cowboy boots so loud?</strong></h2><p class="p1">As we mentioned earlier, cowboy boots can seem oddly loud for a variety of reasons.</p><p class="p1">The main reasons for loud cowboy boots that thud on the ground could either be that your cowboy boots are a tad loose, which makes them hit the ground at a different rate than your feet. Also, most cowboy boots have a little bit of a heel, so the heel might make a sound that is impossible to avoid unless you sand down the heel, which could ruin the shoe.</p><p class="p1">Cowboy boots could be squeaking due to a whole host of causes. The chief reasons behind squeaky cowboy boots include unattached outer or inner soles. Sometimes the bottom of the cowboy boots has gotten gummy from coming into contact with a sticky substance and they squeak as they lift from the floor. New, old or inflexible leather will also make a squeaking sound. Sometimes the cowboy boots squeak because they have come in contact with water either through the rain or through traipsing through muddy terrain. This can cause the shoes to squeak until they get cleaned off or dry naturally.</p><hr><h2 class="p2"><strong>How do you make your cowboy boots quieter?</strong></h2><p class="p1">This really depends on the source of the annoyingly loud sound and the type of sound. If the heels of cowboy boots are clacking loudly and disturbing those around you, there are not many solutions to this other than trying to tread more lightly and mindfully. Taking shorter, lighter strides might fix this issue.</p><p class="p1">If the issue is related to squeaking, the solution will depend entirely on the source of the problem. For boots that squeak because they are tacky on the bottom, a simple inspection of the bottom of the shoe and wiping it down with a wet cloth should solve the problem. They may still squeak for a little bit as they dry, so you can speed up the quieting-down process by drying them with a clean, dry cloth after wiping them down. If the issue is an unattached sole, using an appropriate adhesive recommended by a leather specialist should fix the loud noise issue. When the problem seems to be related to the soles coming in contact with water, drying them off with a clean dry cloth should remedy the issue.</p><p class="p1">Finally, if the issue seems to be the condition of the leather such as dryness or stiffness or aging, using a leather conditioner might help the boots make less noise. However, it is best to consult with a leather specialist or do your research before applying any old leather product to your boots. If you apply an inappropriate solution to the leather, it could ruin it or make it worse.</p><p class="p1">If your boots are still loud after a thorough examination and application of whatever seems to be the most appropriate course of action, you may want to consult with other cowboy boot enthusiasts to see if they have suggestions to solve the issue.</p><hr><h2 class="p2"><strong>Are cowboy boots supposed to be loud?</strong></h2><p class="p1">Yes and no.</p><p class="p1">Since cowboy boots usually have a heel and are sometimes a heavy-weighted shoe to help them hold up to ranch-related tasks for years, they can be louder than lighter footwear such as tennis shoes or flat sandals. However, squeaking is a sound that might indicate that something is wrong with your boots. At the very least, squeaking is an issue that can usually be fixed with a little investigation and some work.</p><hr><h2 class="p2"><strong>What does it mean if cowboy boots are loud?</strong></h2><p class="p1">If your cowboy boots are squeaking, it could mean that there is an issue with the soles, something is sticking to the bottom of the shoe, the leather quality is old or stiffening up, or it could mean that the insoles have absorbed some water that needs drying out.</p><p class="p1">Depending on how loud your cowboy boots are or what type of loud sound they are making, it could mean that they are just being normal cowboy boots. Some clacking of the heels is a totally normal sound to hear coming from the heels of cowboy boots.</p><hr><h2 class="p2"><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2><p class="p1"><strong>In short, cowboy boots can be loud for many different reasons. It all comes down to the individual pair of boots. Whether your boots are heavy, sticky, wet, disconnecting from their soles, relatively new, or beginning to show their age or dryness levels, squeaking sounds are not exactly normal for cowboy boots.</strong></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
