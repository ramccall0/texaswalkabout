In this article, we will discuss whether you can wear cowboy boots to an interview, what kind of boots to wear to an interview, why someone would wear cowboy boots to an interview, and how to wear cowboy boots with dress pants. We will also cover what color boots to choose for an interview and whether to clean your boots before the interview.</strong></p><h2>Can you wear cowboy boots to an interview?</h2><p><strong>The short answer is, yes, you can wear cowboy boots to a job interview–as long as they are dress boots that match your interview attire.</strong></p><p> </p><p>Additionally, it is important to shine and clean your dress cowboy boots beforehand to make a neat first impression.</p><p> </p><h2>What kind of boots can I wear to an interview?</h2><p><strong>Unless your work requires a specific type of boots–such as ranch work or manufacturing–dress cowboy boots in a matching color scheme to your outfit are the best option for an interview.</strong></p><p> </p><p>For very casual job interviews, you may be able to get away with wearing regular cowboy boots. If your interview takes place on a ranch and is related to a ranch position, regular cowboy boots might be the most practical choice. Don’t be afraid to ask an interviewer what dress or shoes they recommend for the interview.</p><p> </p><p>If there is a skills component to the interview on a ranch filled with mud and horse manure, you may regret bringing your best boots. However, in an office setting or a corporate setting, taking the time to polish and clean dress cowboy boots can make the difference between scoring the job and receiving a rejection email.</p><h2>Why would you wear cowboy boots to an interview?</h2><p><strong>You may want to wear cowboy boots to an interview because they are comfortable, stylish, and convey your personality in a bold way.</strong></p><p>Plus, cowboy boots are always in season. Whether you are interviewing in the summer, spring, winter, or fall, cowboy boots will keep your feet comfortable. When you feel comfortable, you can stride into an interview with confidence.</p><p>Besides style and personal expression, cowboy boots might be the most practical choice for an interview in outdoor work, maintenance, manufacturing, or agriculture. Especially if you expect to work with livestock, cowboy boots are a natural choice.</p><h2>Should you clean your boots beforehand?</h2><p><strong>You should clean your boots before the interview, regardless of what type of work you intend to get.</strong></p><p>Even if you might get muddy at the interview site, walking in with polished boots gives the impression that you pay attention to details. An interviewer will undoubtedly take notice. When you put your best foot forward–pun intended!–you increase your chances of moving forward in the hiring process.</p><p>Although it is a seemingly small task, cleaning your boots before the big day shows that you have a work ethic and take pride in your work. Whether it feels right or not, the truth is, employers will take notice of this.</p><h2>Wearing dress pants with boots</h2><p><strong>When you wear dress pants with boots, opt for either a leg that is wide enough to go over the boots or a leg that is tapered enough to fit into the boots.</strong></p><p>Make sure that the pants are long enough to cover the ankles but not so long that they drag on the floor and risk getting caught under a cowboy boot’s heel.</p><h2>What color boots should you wear to an interview?</h2><p><strong>The color of boots to wear to an interview strongly depends on the color of the rest of your outfit.</strong></p><p>When in doubt, neutral tones like black, brown, gray, and navy are a good place to start. Avoid anything flashy like red or metallic-colored boots. Also, avoid complicated designs unless you are interviewing to work at a specialty retailer that sells designer cowboy boots.</p><p>It may also be best to keep white and cream boots in the closet on an interview day. After all, white and cream tones are a blank canvas for dirt and stains to occupy for the long haul. No amount of cleaning or shining can turn some light-colored boots back to their original clean slate. Plus, no one wants to accidentally step in mud minutes before walking into the interview and letting everyone see it on their boots.</p><p>For a professional look that is guaranteed to stay sharp all day, go for the darkest colored boots that will match the rest of your outfit. Beige and warm-toned interview clothes will probably match best with brown, whereas more colorful, bright interview clothes might coordinate better with blue or navy. Use your best judgment and know that while shoe color is important, it will most likely not make or break your interview experience.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p><strong>In conclusion, you can absolutely wear cowboy boots to a job interview–don’t let anyone tell you differently! Just shine and clean the boots the night before the job interview, choose a dress pair of boots to stand out as a serious professional with personality (and stay comfortable), and choose dress pants that either cover the boots or tuck into them. For color, opt for boots that match the rest of your outfit and stay in a neutral color palette if possible.</strong></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
