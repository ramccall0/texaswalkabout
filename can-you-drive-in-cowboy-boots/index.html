Yes you can!</strong></h2><p>There’s <a href="https://www.motorbiscuit.com/illegal-wear-high-heels-while-driving/">no law</a> in the US saying you <em>can’t</em> drive in boots that have heels on them, so if that’s your wish, then go ahead!</p><p>However, the positioning of your feet around the pedals might be a bit awkward, so exercise caution before starting up your vehicle.</p><p>One idea you could try is testing your boots to see how they contact the pedals.</p><p>Of course, make sure your engine is off and the vehicle is in park before you do this.</p><p>If nothing feels weird or unsafe to you, then it should be safe to drive with cowboy boots on.</p><hr><h2><strong>Should you drive while wearing cowboy boots? That’s up to you, but consider some tips before hitting the road.</strong></h2><p>Despite no law barring the use of cowboy boots while driving, many driving experts advise <a href="https://www.motorbiscuit.com/what-not-wear-driving-car/">against</a> wearing them when you’re behind the wheel.</p><p>The reason is that certain footwear reduces the ability for your feet to feel the pedals.</p><p>The thicker the soles, the harder it is to know if your foot is, in fact, on the brake pedal or not.</p><p>High-heels and wedges are the worst for driving. Cowboy boots usually fit into that heel category.</p><p>The higher the heel on your pair of boots, the riskier it gets.</p><p>However, this doesn’t mean it’s completely unsafe to drive with that slick pair of boots you own.</p><p>In fact, there are a few <a href="https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/can-you-drive-in-cowboy-boots/">advantages</a> that come with wearing cowboy boots while driving. You can depend on better toe protection than other simpler kinds of footwear, and seeing how <a href="https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/how-long-do-cowboy-boots-last/">durable</a> cowboy boots are, you can expect to drive in that pair for many years to come.</p><hr><h2><strong>How do you go driving in cowboy boots? Carefully.</strong></h2><p>Yes, there are some advantages when it comes to cowboy boots and driving, but keep in mind the warnings too.</p><p>For example, even though the toes can protect you from impact damage, constantly applying the break and gas can <a href="https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/can-you-drive-in-cowboy-boots/">wear down</a> your feet and legs in a hurry.</p><p>This applies to narrow toe boxes, so to avoid this issue, pick a pair of boots with more toe room. The last thing you want while riding down the road is to have your feet seize up from cramps and pain.</p><p>For those driving under three hours per trip, issues such as narrow toe boxes and a lack of proper foot support shouldn’t be much of an issue.</p><p>However, for those who will be behind the wheel for hours on end, grab some gel pads in addition to selecting a pair of cowboy boots that will give your toes more space to feel and operate.</p><p>To sum things up, it’s not so much <em>how</em> you drive in boots, it’s <em>what</em> you decide to wear for long trips.</p><p>Any of the above risks are not guaranteed to happen, but the longer you drive in cowboy boots, the more likely you’ll experience discomfort and pain. Plan ahead before getting in the driver’s seat.</p><hr><h2><strong>Which shoes are best for driving? Something that’s flat and allows your feet to feel the pedals better.</strong></h2><p>Shoes that are a good bet for driving include <a href="https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-driving-shoes">thin soles</a> that allow the driver to better feel which pedal is which.</p><p>One of the best soles to look out for is a “pebbled” one, allowing just about any person to feel what’s underneath.</p><p>Some examples of these shoes include loafers, moccasins, and Uggs. Various kinds of sneakers and specialized <a href="https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-driving-shoes">racing boots</a> can work well too.</p><p>However, these kinds of footwear aren’t mandatory, just highly recommended for long periods of driving.</p><p>Cowboy boots can do the job as well, just as long as you consider the state of your feet and how they behave on long road trips.</p><hr><h2><strong>Can I pull off cowboy boots? You can with the right outfit.</strong></h2><p>Wearing cowboy boots means you’re making a statement.</p><p>Whether it’s for style, your cultural background, or simply wanting to try something interesting, people <em>will</em> notice your boots once you step out of the driver’s seat.</p><p>A good piece of advice to consider is selecting a nice pair of <a href="https://www.t3.com/us/features/best-driving-shoes">jeans</a> that can match your cowboy boots.</p><p>Pairs like boot-cut jeans will match your boots in a stylish way. To achieve a more modern look, pick some jeans in dark blue or even charcoal wash.</p><p>Also, let’s not forget about cowboy boots. If you’re going for appearance, check out this handy <a href="https://www.ariat.com/al/cowboy-boot-styles">style-guide</a> to help you achieve the best look.</p><p>For heavy duty jobs like cargo truck driving and construction, seriously consider getting a pair of <a href="https://www.ariat.com/mens-cowboy-boots?sz=24">work</a> cowboy boots.</p><p>Remember that bit earlier about toe protection? Most work boots these days have steel toes in them, which will keep your feet safe from harm.</p><hr><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>There’s no one particular way to drive perfectly in cowboy boots.</p><p>Everyone has different feet and preferences in how long they drive.</p><p>The biggest thing, however, to consider is how <em>comfortable</em> your feet are in cowboy boots. You won’t drive in anything <em>un</em>comfortable, so pick something that will prevent that.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
