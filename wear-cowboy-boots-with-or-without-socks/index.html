That means wearing socks for both Chelsea and Cowboy style boots with longer shafts. Most boots are made of coarse leather, which is prone to moisture damage, bad smells, and a myriad of other things. Therefore, you don't want to taint your classy looking outfit by forgetting to put your socks on!</strong></p><p></p><p></p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><figure class="wp-image-1222"><img loading="lazy" src="https://texaswalkabout.com/media/posts/2/IMG_3499-768x1024.jpeg" sizes="(min-width: 1260px) calc(3.22vw + 703px), (min-width: 900px) calc(50.59vw + 116px), (min-width: 840px) calc(5vw + 684px), calc(85.58vw + 23px)" srcset="https://texaswalkabout.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_3499-768x1024-xs.jpeg 320w, https://texaswalkabout.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_3499-768x1024-sm.jpeg 480w, https://texaswalkabout.com/media/posts/2/responsive/IMG_3499-768x1024-md.jpeg 768w" alt=""></figure><figcaption>My new pair of Lucchese Boots</figcaption></figure></div><p></p><p></p><hr class="wp-block-separator"><p></p><h2 class="has-text-align-center">Should you wear cowboy boots without socks?</h2><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center">It is always recommended to wear a pair of socks with your cowboy boots. The reasoning behind this is simply that the shaft will start to irritate your skin as soon as you try and wear a pair of boots without any socks. When you don't wear socks, the boot leather will start to rub against your leg, causing a lot of irritation. You don't want that.</p><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center">When wearing boots, you want it to be as comfortable as possible. Also ask yourself the question, why would you honestly even consider wearing a pair of boots without any socks? This will just further ruin the experience.</p><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center">Not to mention, when you start walking around, you may begin to sweat quite a bit and make the leather stink.</p><p></p><p></p><hr class="wp-block-separator"><p></p><h2 class="has-text-align-center">Are you supposed to wear socks with boots?</h2><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>You are always supposed to wear socks with boots. Not only are you supposed to be wearing socks, they should be long socks that go all the way up past your calve. That's simply because of the elongated shaft of many boots that people wear.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center">You can find boot styled socks anywhere that sells cowboy boots. Usually, it is relatively thick material that is able to withstand a lot of friction from the shaft part of the boot.</p><p></p><p></p><hr class="wp-block-separator"><p></p><h2 class="has-text-align-center">Thick or thin socks with cowboy boots</h2><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>If you're trying to decide on thick or thin socks to wear with your cowboy boots, always try to go for the thicker cut of socks. They're usually more durable and can retain heat better if you happen to be wearing it out in the cold. There's really no downside for thick cut socks.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center">Thin socks on the other hand, are frankly a lot harder to be higher quality. They don't last as long, and if you happen to be out in the elements, then you will certainly be more exposed.</p><p></p><p></p><h3 class="has-text-align-center"><span class="has-inline-color has-theme-palette-1-color">Quality of the sock</span></h3><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>The quality of your boot socks matter. That's because they need to withstand the constant friction of rubbing against the elongated shaft of the boot. Not only that, but just in general, thicker material will just last longer. There's more room for the fabric to start degrading.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center">When you just have a thin little piece of fabric that you call a sock, once it starts eroding away - you're not left with a whole lot.</p><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center">Whenever you're in the store, just grab a nice, thick pair of boot styled socks to save yourself a lot of headache down the road.</p><p></p><p></p><hr class="wp-block-separator"><p></p><h2 class="has-text-align-center">Best socks to wear with cowboy boots</h2><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center">The best socks to wear with cowboy boots are ones that are very comfortable, thick in quality, and match the coloring of your boots specifically.</p><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Whenever youâ€™re out shopping for some socks to wear with your cowboy boots, make sure to always grab quality material. This is the most critical part of buying socks that can withstand the coarse nature of the leather shaft of the boot. Having thick and great quality socks to wear with your boots allows for a longer shelflife.Â </strong></p><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center">Like with most things, you donâ€™t want to always have to buy a lot of different clothes just for the sake of buying clothes. You want to think of buying your socks as an investment and not a cost.Â </p><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center">Even though theyâ€™re thicker quality and are probably a lot more expensive than thinner types of socks, rest assured that you will hardly ever need to buy socks again for your boots.</p><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center">If youâ€™re into style and want to present yourself in an excellent way, consider getting boot socks that match the leather coloring of your boots.Â </p><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center">Even though for the most part, you will never be able to see them because of the long shaft of the boot, it still looks really cool if you ever happened to roll your jeans or pants up to where others can see the coloring of your socks. Having matching clothes is always a plus.</p><p></p><p></p><hr class="wp-block-separator"><p></p><h2 class="has-text-align-center">Socks that stay up in boots</h2><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Finally, youâ€™ll want to not only get socks that look cool and that are of high-quality, but you will also want to obtain socks that are relatively comfortable. For the most part, boots are not that comfortable of shoes to be walking around in to begin with. Not to mention having to get very thick socks that roll all the way up to your knees.Â </strong></p><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center">Great way to make this a little bit more enjoyable and pleasurable, is to get socks that have plenty of cushioning and her overall very comfortable to wear.</p><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center">You donâ€™t want socks that are uncomfortable and are always falling down, so just make sure to grab some very high-quality thick, and comfortable types of socks to wear with your cowboy boots.</p><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center">Another thing to consider when youâ€™re deciding on whether or not to wear socks while wearing boots, is to grab some socks that fit you well enough. That means get socks that are somewhat tight but not too uncomfortable.Â </p><p></p><p></p><p class="has-text-align-center">This will just help the socks stay in place and ensure that you never have to you always roll up your pants and reapply the socks back up to your knees. Iâ€™ve done that many times and itâ€™s frankly very annoying.</p><p></p></div><aside class="post__sidebar post__sidebar--left"><div class="sidebar sidebar--sticky"><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Share on:</h3><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwear-cowboy-boots-with-or-without-socks%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwear-cowboy-boots-with-or-without-socks%2F&amp;via=Texas%20Walkabout&amp;text=Should%20You%20Wear%20cowboy%20boots%20with%20or%20without%20socks%3F%20(Explained)" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwear-cowboy-boots-with-or-without-socks%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=Should%20You%20Wear%20cowboy%20boots%20with%20or%20without%20socks%3F%20(Explained)" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pinterest </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwear-cowboy-boots-with-or-without-socks%2F" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mix </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwear-cowboy-boots-with-or-without-socks%2F" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Should%20You%20Wear%20cowboy%20boots%20with%20or%20without%20socks%3F%20(Explained)&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwear-cowboy-boots-with-or-without-socks%2F" class="js-share buffer" title="Share with Buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Buffer </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Should%20You%20Wear%20cowboy%20boots%20with%20or%20without%20socks%3F%20(Explained) https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwear-cowboy-boots-with-or-without-socks%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp</a></div></section><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Tagged in:</h3><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/" title="Cowboy Boots">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/" title="Western Wear">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div></section><nav class="sidebar__item post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Previous post:</h3><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/about/" rel="next">About</a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Next post:</h3><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/what-color-cowboy-hat-to-wear-with-brown-boots/" rel="next">What color cowboy hat to wear with brown boots?
