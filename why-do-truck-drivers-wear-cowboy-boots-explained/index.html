Those folks are obviously stuck back in the old days when cowboy boots were originally made. These statements are no longer true.</strong></p><p><strong>In today's world it is possible to buy models of jeans AND cowboy boots that are very comfortable to wear all day. The focus of this article is the comfort factor and other related subtopics of cowboy boots worn by truck drivers. Please read all the way until the end.</strong></p><hr><h2>Why do truck drivers prefer cowboy boots?</h2><p>There are some people who adorn different footwear for different purposes. They might wear certain shoes to work, other shoes to go out at night with, and perhaps really fancy shoes for that special occasion. We all know those people, right?</p><p><strong>Truck drivers are not able to do this. Their footwear must be multi-functional. This is where cowboy boots come into play. If they purchased the right model for themselves in the first place, that one pair of boots is perfect for all those occasions we just mentioned.</strong></p><hr><h2>Does this article only apply to men?</h2><p><strong>No, it applies to all genders. Although it may still be rare, there are some women truck drivers. The same reasons why men truck drivers like cowboy boots can apply to women's cowgirl boots.</strong></p><p>There are hundreds of varieties of cowgirl boots that a woman can wear and be comfortable all the time. This includes if she drives a truck. So, if you are a woman, you should pay attention to this article. Ladies, you can enjoy your boots!</p><hr><h2>Cowboy boots offer unequaled foot protection too</h2><p><strong>What? What are we talking about? A person's feet must be protected from extreme temperatures, both cold and hot. Additionally, they do not want wet feet from rain or snow.</strong></p><p><strong>Again, truck drivers do not have the luxury of carrying footwear for each purpose. In all cases, cowboy boots will protect a truck driver's feet from these things. One perfect pair of boots is all he or she needs to bring along.</strong></p><hr><h2>Are cowboy boots comfortable to wear during long drives?</h2><p><strong>Again, it depends on the model of cowboy boots you buy. When people think of cowboy boots, they envision long pointed toes, slippery soles, and higher heels. Boots like that do exist, but they are not your only options.</strong></p><p>In today's market it is plausible to buy several pairs that are more comfortable. Yet they are definitely still cowboy boots. These models of cowboy boots are stylish and very slick-looking, but are more practical choices for truckers or anyone that drives a lot. Be sure to allow for a break-in period before using them for work.</p><hr><h2>Are cowboy boots DOT approved for truck drivers' footwear?</h2><p><strong>The DOT regulations state that any driver who operates a commercial vehicle on a public highway must wear shoes. They also are not permitted to remove their shoes while in operation mode. There is nothing that states cowboy boots are not allowed to be worn.</strong></p><hr><h2>Common sense should prevail here!</h2><p><strong>While there is no law against wearing cowboy boots from the US DOT, common sense should prevail. Cowboy boots do not magically appear on your feet, you must buy them. Common sense also dictates you try the boots on before buying them. Keep trying on various pairs until you find that perfect pair for truck driving. Then buy two or three of those. This will avoid not having the right boots at any one time.</strong></p><p>You ought to know if you will be wearing them while driving long distances in a big rig. Therefore, YOU must determine if they will be comfortable enough for you. If there is any doubt in your mind, do not buy that pair. With so many choices in today's marketplace, you need not buy boots that are not comfortable, right? Right!</p><hr><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p><strong>Sure, you can wear cowboy boots while driving a large truck. But, is it a good idea? As we have been discussing, it is a fantastic idea as long as you buy the right models. When you enter the western boot store, tell the sales associate you want pairs that are suitable for your occupation. He or she should be able to direct you to the correct section.</strong></p><p>Keep in mind, you need not give up style in order to receive practicality. With so many makes and models of boots available, it is completely possible to buy and wear cowboy boots that are comfortable for truckers!</p></div><aside class="post__sidebar post__sidebar--left"><div class="sidebar sidebar--sticky"><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Share on:</h3><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhy-do-truck-drivers-wear-cowboy-boots-explained%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhy-do-truck-drivers-wear-cowboy-boots-explained%2F&amp;via=Texas%20Walkabout&amp;text=Why%20do%20truck%20drivers%20wear%20cowboy%20boots%3F%20(Explained)" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhy-do-truck-drivers-wear-cowboy-boots-explained%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=Why%20do%20truck%20drivers%20wear%20cowboy%20boots%3F%20(Explained)" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pinterest </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhy-do-truck-drivers-wear-cowboy-boots-explained%2F" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mix </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhy-do-truck-drivers-wear-cowboy-boots-explained%2F" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Why%20do%20truck%20drivers%20wear%20cowboy%20boots%3F%20(Explained)&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhy-do-truck-drivers-wear-cowboy-boots-explained%2F" class="js-share buffer" title="Share with Buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Buffer </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Why%20do%20truck%20drivers%20wear%20cowboy%20boots%3F%20(Explained) https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhy-do-truck-drivers-wear-cowboy-boots-explained%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp</a></div></section><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Tagged in:</h3><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/" title="Cowboy Boots">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/" title="Western Wear">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div></section><nav class="sidebar__item post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Previous post:</h3><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/do-cowboy-boots-provide-ankle-support-explained/" rel="next">Do cowboy boots provide ankle support?  (Explained)</a></div></nav></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__author"><div><h3 class="h6"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/authors/texas-walkabout/" rel="author">Texas Walkabout</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><div class="post__related"><h3>Related post</h3><div class="l-grid"><article class="c-card c-card--compact"><div class="c-card__body"><header><h2 class="c-card__title c-card__title--compact"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/sports-coat-with-jeans-and-cowboy-boots/">7 Tips For Wearing A Sports Coat With Jeans And Cowboy Boots </a></h2></header><div class="metadata c-card__metadata c-card__metadata--compact"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/" class="metadata__maintag">Cowboy Boots</a> <a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/authors/texas-walkabout/" class="metadata__author">Texas Walkabout</a> <time datetime="2022-03-06T11:20" class="metadata__date">03.06.2022</time></div></div></article><article class="c-card c-card--compact"><div class="c-card__body"><header><h2 class="c-card__title c-card__title--compact"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/do-pants-go-over-or-under-cowboy-boots/">Do pants go over or under cowboy boots?
