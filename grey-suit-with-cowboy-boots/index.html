Or you want to dress for a night of fun, but you want to look good in front of all your friends, family, and peers. Despite dressing for formality or just wanting to let off a bit of steam, looking good can make you <em>feel</em> good.</p><p>An important occasion is coming up, and you want to try out some cowboy boots and a grey suit combination. Yet, is the combo you have in your mind the best choice? What will others think? Worry not, for we’ll discuss which boots can work with grey suits, and the fine details that will bring out the style <em>and</em> confidence.</p><h2><strong>How can you pair cowboy boots with a grey suit?</strong></h2><p><strong>The answer lies in your attitude.</strong></p><p>The question you should be asking yourself isn’t whether your clothes are worthy of you, it’s if <em>you’re</em> worthy of your clothes. When pairing <em>any</em> suit with cowboy boots, how you carry yourself matters.</p><p>Wearing both a suit and cowboy boots outside of Texas is described as a: <a href="https://www.dmarge.com/how-to-wear-boots-with-suit">"big and bold statement."</a> If you haven’t already, brush up on your swagger.</p><p>If you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed at the moment, don’t sweat, because you don't need the charisma of a Country Super star just to pull off the look you’re going for. What can help you in the short term is learning how to <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Walk-with-Confidence">walk with confidence</a>. Once you practice this advice often enough, you’ll start to feel <em>great</em> in your grey suit and cowboy boots combo. With enough time and effort, others will start to notice as well, and admire you for it.</p><h2><strong>Should you wear a grey suit with cowboy boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>You can, if you know how to pull it off.</strong></p><p>Now you’re asking yourself not if you can pull off the grey suit and boots, but <em>should</em> you? Having a confident attitude may be important to achieve it, but don’t skip the details as well. Specifically, suit accessories such as the right shirt and tie.</p><p>A great choice of shirt to go with whichever hue of grey suit you own is a white one. However, it’s not the only color that can work. Navy, pink, and blue are all colors that will pair nicely with grey. Whichever your choice, the shirt should look clean and crisp. Take your time to give it a good wash, optional bleach, and a solid ironing to make it look the best.</p><p>Next up is the tie. Again, the color is what you should focus on. Popular choices include “true blue,” maroon, forest green, and red.</p><p>The shading can matter too, as you want your tie to stand out (you’re working on your swagger, remember?), so whichever shirt/tie combination you choose, if one is dark, the other should be lighter.</p><h2><strong>What color boots go well with a grey suit?</strong></h2><p><strong>Options are a bit limited, but you can be flexible with them.</strong></p><p>It’s more than likely that the most important piece is the cowboy boots themselves. For grey suits, it’s recommended you go with either brown, cherry black, or plain black for the boot color.</p><p>Darker colors might be better in the case of a <em>light</em> grey suit. Darker grey suits can pair well with brown shoes, as the hues will be similar and won’t risk a color clash.</p><p>On an important note, these colors can also be used on different kinds of boots altogether. We’ll touch up on that a bit later.</p><p><strong>Bonus content: There are other types of boots!</strong></p><p>You’re your own boss, so whichever pair of boots you want to wear on your feet, that’s that. However, that being said, it’s always a good idea to expand your options.</p><p>For example, you can go with a nice-looking pair of oxfords, <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Walk-with-Confidence">"capped toes"</a>, or even your own dress shoes (if you already own a pair), as long as they are burgundy or black. Consider doing this instead if your cowboy boots are bright in color.</p><p>Other options that will work great with a grey suit are <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Clarks-Mens-Chukka-Nubuc-Numeric_10_Point_5/dp/B08FVHXL8L/ref=asc_df_B08FVHXL8L/?tag=googleshopc0c-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=570082828694&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17643113985851333354&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9001319&amp;hvtargid=pla-1434520040774&amp;psc=1">Chukka boots</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Generic1-Chelsea-Anti-Slip-Waterproof-Business/dp/B08Y8RHVS7">Chelsea</a>-style footwear. These types have been known to be more “stylish,” meaning they’re great for formal occasions.</p><p>If you <a href="https://www.dmarge.com/how-to-wear-boots-with-suit">tailor your dress pants</a> right, you can try out boots made by RM Williams. Just another side note, that’s another thing you should iron and clean correctly, because gaining confidence can be hard when everyone’s smiling at all your pant crinkles.</p><p>Whichever of these you think is the best second choice, it’s recommended that you get a pair that’s in leather.</p><p>Leather, especially polished, tends to have a more refined look whenever it’s paired with a suit. Bonus points if you can do that with lighter colors, such as brown.</p><p>When it comes down to it, cowboy boots are fine. Just don’t forget that you have other options.</p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>Whereas the suit can make the man, the man can also make the suit. If you’ve looked at yourself many times in the mirror with your chosen combo and still don’t approve, at least try walking inside your home for a while. Keep your chin up, and eyes straight ahead.</p><p>If you can, get some of your buddies to dress the same! Being around people you’re familiar with can help shrug off some of the nervous feelings while in public. You’re just trying to make a fashion statement, not attend a funeral.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
