From dozens of film stars in the past to people walking out in the streets, the cowboy boot is always present in some way, shape or form.</p><p>Aside from the cowboys of old, why do people still wear them today? In this article, we’ll go over some details as to what makes the cowboy boot a cultural icon in our present times.</p><h2><strong>Why do southerners wear cowboy boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>It’s a staple part of their culture.</strong></p><p>By using the term “southerner,” most will refer to multiple US states, such as Texas and Oklahoma, for example. The short answer as to why cowboy boots are worn down there is that they are part of their cultural identity.</p><p>To see why that is, we have to look back into the past, around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_boot">19th century</a> to be exact. Even though the “riding” boot had been around for much longer than that, the traditional “cowboy” boot didn’t arise until around the 1860s. The one we know of today began around Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas, specifically areas that had high amounts of cattle ranching activity.</p><p>Considering how important horse-riding was back then, riders from all across the US needed a reliable boot that could easily be inserted into saddle stirrups.</p><p>After the boot was popularized by the boot-making company Hyer Brothers Boots, the rest is history.</p><p>Even today, the cowboy boot is still used for its <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Texans-like-to-wear-cowboy-boots">original purpose</a>. Case in point, cowboys still exist.</p><p>Many people still need reliable footwear to help them accomplish their daily ranching and farming work. A big reason for this is that the cowboy boot has withstood the test of time due to its incredible durability, and may continue to be so in the future.</p><h2><strong>What does wearing cowboy boots mean?</strong></h2><p><strong>It makes a statement.</strong></p><p>Aside from their practical uses, cowboy boots also give a person a sense of identity. It can also provide a <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/being-texan/texans-boots-reflections-favorite-people/">political</a> statement for those traveling outside their southern homeland. It essentially identifies where that person is from, and what they stand for.</p><p>To an outsider, a pair of cowboy boots are just boots, but to someone who’s from the southern culture, it means so much more. Wearing them represents a rich history and a certain way of life.</p><p>Yes, some may just need a good work-boot to help them through the day, but cowboy boots also serve as a fashion style as well. It’s almost as if that person is saying, “This is where I come from, and don’t you forget it!”</p><p>Wearing them can also mean that a person is exhibiting <a href="https://wehearthandmadeboots.com/5-things-wearing-cowboy-boots-says-about-a-person/">confidence</a> out in public. This in a way relates to making a statement. If you’re going to look unique on <em>purpose</em>, you’d need confidence to stick out comfortably around dozens of others that look different than you.</p><h2><strong>Are cowboy boots functional?</strong></h2><p><strong>Very much so.</strong></p><p>Even the earliest of cowboy boots were incredibly functional, and if cared for properly, could last for years on end. Seeing as how most pairs back then (and even today) were made of stacked leather, a well-made pair of cowboy boots could withstand just about anything the world throws at it.</p><p>Probably the most <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Texans-like-to-wear-cowboy-boots">common function</a> they serve today is being a stylish work boot. Some are even fitted with steel toes to protect the wearer’s feet from modern dangers. Also, considering how important ranching and farming are still, present-day cowboys want and <em>need</em> a reliable set of footwear to get the job done.</p><p>Considering their original purpose for long-term outdoor wear, cowboy boots still serve millions of people just as they did way back then (and in many ways, better than before). And with the great outdoors, also came its dangers. Not only can cowboy boots protect the wearer from heat and wet mud, but also from dangerous creatures such as venomous snakes and spiders.</p><p>Cowboy boots are also considered fashionable in many places. Areas in the southern social sphere will have just about everyone wearing them.</p><h2><strong>What state wears the most cowboy boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>Texas.</strong></p><p>Also known as <a href="https://lisbdnet.com/what-state-has-the-most-cowboys/">"the State of the Cowboy Boot,"</a> Texas is said to have the most modern-day cowboys. Along with Utah, Kansas, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Texas helps host the most ranches in the southern US. Although, oddly enough, the very first cowboy didn’t come from any of those states.</p><p>The original cowboy state was Florida of all places. They were called “vaqueros” (Spanish word) at the time, meaning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaquero">"herder of cattle"</a>more-or less in English.</p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>So to recap, cowboy boots have been around for quite a long time. Even though they were originally made for comfortably riding horses, they crossed over into the farming, outdoor working, and fashion industries as well. If anything, it’s highly probable that more people than ever are wearing them today!</p><p>If certified correctly, cowboy boots can be used for just about any work environment, even for more formal office wear. If you’re a <a href="https://shsroundtable.com/showcase/2014/05/12/what-to-wear-to-a-country-concert/">country music fan</a>, expect to see just about anyone wearing them. You might even have someone ask you, “hey, where’s <em>your</em> pair?”</p><p>You don’t have to be from Texas either to enjoy the benefits of wearing western boots. Most consider them for comfort in addition to standing out. If <a href="https://stageswest.com/blog/benefits-of-wearing-cowboy-boots/">made </a>correct, you can wear them in just about any situation, even hiking if the terrain isn’t too rough.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/is-boerne-lake-open-to-the-public/" class="invert">Is Boerne lake open to the public?
