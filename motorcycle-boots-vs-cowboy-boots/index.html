Some include practical ones like work, or the wearer simply wants to show off a neat design and make a statement. When it comes to motorcycling, riders need a tough boot that can last many journeys on the road. However, will any boot do the job? What about cowboy boots? In this article, we’ll discuss the details for each type that make them the way they are.</p><h2><strong>What similarities do motorcycle and cowboy boots share?</strong></h2><p><strong>Not a whole lot.</strong></p><p>Whereas both kinds of footwear are constructed using leather, another common thing the two share is laceless construction. This means each boot is designed for the wearer to slip it on and off without too much hassle.</p><p>One last commonality to note is how both boots give the wearer added ankle (and sometimes calf) protection from the elements. However, the reason for this is different for each, and dependent on the purpose each boot is designed for.</p><h2><strong>What are the differences between motorcycle and cowboy boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>It’s a long list.</strong></p><p>One big difference wearers will notice is how much heavier motorcycle boots are overall. Whereas a pair of cowboy boots can weight up to 6 lbs, a single motorcycle boot can weigh as much as 4.6 lbs (9.2 lbs per pair). This is due to the materials that each type of boot is made of.</p><p>Even though both boots have leather in them, cowboy boots will have a lot more in their construction to make them more versatile. Motorcycle boots, on the other hand, also have many synthetic materials added to compensate for motorcycle heat and friction. Some materials include high-density nylon and fiberglass.</p><p>With all of those extra materials inside them, motorcycle boots are the better choice when safety is concerned. If you’re riding a speedy metal machine that produces large amounts of exhaust heat, you’d want something to keep your feet safe from burns.</p><p>What if you wanted to try using a pair of cowboy boots for motorcycle riding anyways? Well, in the US at least, you <a href="https://motorcyclebrave.com/can-you-wear-cowboy-boots-on-a-motorcycle/">can</a>, but it’s recommended that you avoid doing so.</p><p>Cowboy boots have less grip and less protection that motorcycle boots offer. Not only will you risk burns and other kinds of damage to your legs, but it might also be much harder to shift gears while riding.</p><p>One such advantage that cowboy boots have over the motorcycle type is better overall durability. A pair of western footwear can last up to 10 years or more, due to the leather most are made of. The time any pair of boots last, however, is the care you provide and what you use them for.</p><h2><strong>How do both of these boots compare in price?</strong></h2><p><strong>A quality pair of motorcycle boots is slightly cheaper.</strong></p><p>However, it depends on the model and brand you’re looking at. Motorcycle boots may be <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorcycle-Boots/s?k=Motorcycle+Boots">cheaper</a> than their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mens-Western-Boots/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=11721159011">cowboy</a> counterparts on <em>average</em>, but it also depends what you’ll be using the boots <em>for</em>.</p><p>If you need something for motorcycling, go with motorcycle boots just about every time. Cowboy boots were never intended for riding a mechanical steed that can reach insane speeds, so it’s highly recommended that you simply use those kinds of boots for something more casual instead.</p><h2><strong>What about functionality?</strong></h2><p><strong>It really depends on what you need boots for.</strong></p><p>Whichever pair of boots you decide to go with, they’ll be more functional if you use them for their intended purposes. For everyday casual (or even formal) wear, cowboy boots beat motorcycle boots in this category. Need a comfortable motorcycling experience? Go with boots made for it. Ride horses a lot? Cowboy boots.</p><p>Cowboy boots are also more convenient to wear in everyday life. Motorcycle boots are usually made with specialization in mind, meaning they are built with multiple straps to securely fasten them to their human owners. Considering how the average motorcycle boot is taller than cowboy ones, it’s also easier to slip cowboy boots on and off.</p><h2><strong>Which type is more comfortable to wear?</strong></h2><p><strong>Again, it depends on their usage.</strong></p><p>Even though cowboy boots are on average, more comfortable than motorcycle ones, individual experiences can vary. It goes without saying that motorcycle boots will be <em>way</em> more comfortable for motorcycle riding if one were to do a comparison. As mentioned earlier, this is due to all the extra materials and padding that go into motorcycle boot construction.</p><p>However, if you try to walk or run in them for long distances, you’re going to notice how hot and uncomfortable your feet will get. So, yeah, cowboy boots have motorcycle boots beat in that area.</p><h2><strong>What are some good motorcycle and cowboy boot brands?</strong></h2><p><strong>You have several to choose from for either.</strong></p><p>For motorcycle boots, some brands to take notice of are SIDI, Alpinestars, and <a href="https://motorbikewriter.com/best-motorcycle-boots/">Belstaff</a>. However, as these are quality products, some models will set you back 400 dollars or more for a single pair.</p><p>For cowboy boots, some of the best brands out there include Ariat and <a href="https://cowboylifestylenetwork.com/top-5-best-cowboy-boot-brands/">Lucchese</a>. Again, similar to motorcycle boots, better quality will mean higher prices.</p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>Regardless of which kind of boot you chose to get, keep in mind their limitations and strengths. Whereas both of them are considered boots by <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/boot">definition</a>, the two of them couldn’t be any more different from each other.</p><p> </p></div><aside class="post__sidebar post__sidebar--left"><div class="sidebar sidebar--sticky"><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Share on:</h3><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fmotorcycle-boots-vs-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fmotorcycle-boots-vs-cowboy-boots%2F&amp;via=Texas%20Walkabout&amp;text=Motorcycle%20boots%20vs%20cowboy%20boots%20(Here's%20What%20To%20Know)" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fmotorcycle-boots-vs-cowboy-boots%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=Motorcycle%20boots%20vs%20cowboy%20boots%20(Here's%20What%20To%20Know)" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pinterest </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fmotorcycle-boots-vs-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mix </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fmotorcycle-boots-vs-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Motorcycle%20boots%20vs%20cowboy%20boots%20(Here's%20What%20To%20Know)&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fmotorcycle-boots-vs-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share buffer" title="Share with Buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Buffer </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Motorcycle%20boots%20vs%20cowboy%20boots%20(Here's%20What%20To%20Know) https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fmotorcycle-boots-vs-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp</a></div></section><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Tagged in:</h3><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/" title="Cowboy Boots">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/" title="Western Wear">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div></section><nav class="sidebar__item post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Previous post:</h3><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/why-do-truckers-wear-cowboy-boots/" rel="next">Why do truckers wear cowboy boots?
