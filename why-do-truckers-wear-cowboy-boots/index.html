These leather riding boots are a popular work shoe and are a favorite of truckers. This is more than just a fashion choice. Cowboy boots offer distinct benefits to truckers and other workers.</strong></p><p><strong>That's not to say that cowboy culture hasn't had an influence on truckers. Many big rig drivers choose to wear cowboy hats along with their boots. Still, it's important to recognize that truckers have a good reason to choose cowboy boots.</strong></p><h2>Why Do Truckers Wear Cowboy Boots?</h2><p><strong>Cowboy boots are durable, warm, and have a snug enough fit to let truckers feel the vehicle's brakes as they're driving. A high-quality boot can also be incredibly comfortable, especially after the boot has been broken in. Over time, the leather on the boots stretch and perfectly adapt to the shape of the wearer's feet.</strong></p><p>Cowboy boots are designed for manual labor, and that makes them a perfect fit for truckers. A good pair of leather boots can stay in great shape for years with minimal maintenance. Since most modern cowboy boots have a midsole system, they also keep your feet cushioned and well-supported, even when boots are worn for 10 hours or more per day.</p><h2>Are There Any Benefits to Wearing Cowboy Boots While Driving a Big Rig?</h2><p><strong>Laceless boots, like cowboy boots, can be much safer for truckers than boots with laces. Laces can potentially become untied while driving. If this happens, they could become tangled around the accelerator or the brakes of the vehicle, which could be dangerous.</strong></p><p>Aside from that, the right pair of cowboy boots will keep feet comfortable, which is essential when driving for long stretches of time. The wrong boots can give truckers blisters or callouses. Cowboy boots keep feet well-supported while still giving them room to stretch.</p><p>In addition, cowboy boots can help keep a trucker's toes protected. The brakes in big rigs are much heavier than brakes systems in standard vehicles. Cowboy boots with reinforced toes can shield the toes and protect them from injury.</p><h2>Is It Illegal to Drive In Cowboy Boots?</h2><p><strong>It's legal for all drivers to wear cowboy boots in every state. Millions of drivers across the country work in these boots. In fact, cowboy boots have been growing in popularity with each passing year.</strong></p><p>With that said, truckers should make sure they choose the right boots. Ideally, the boots should be lightweight with a rubber sole. Boots should also have low heels and plenty of room around the toes. Boots with round toes can promote blood circulation and keep feet comfortable during long drives.</p><h2>What Is the Purpose of Wearing Cowboy Boots?</h2><p><strong>Cowboy boots were originally designed for horse riding. Today, they're still worn by workers in many industries thanks to the superior protection they provide. The long shaft of the boot protects the leg, while the low heel and reinforced toe help to keep the feet secure.</strong></p><p>Each year, more than 53,000 workers suffer foot injuries that lead to missed workdays. That's why workers with tough jobs need to find footwear that will give their feet the protection that they need. Sturdy and comfortable shoes like cowboy boots are perfect for truckers.</p><h2>Do Truckers Wear Cowboy Hats?</h2><p><strong>Cowboy hats have long been a part of trucker culture. While not all truckers will sport a cowboy hat when they're on the road, hats can be a way to protect your eyes from the sun's glare. In addition to cowboy hats and boots, it's common to see truckers sporting plaid shirts and denim.</strong></p><p>Ultimately, truckers require clothing that's functional, durable, and comfortable. Certain types of clothing, like cowboy boots, are popular for a reason, but most truckers aren't required to wear specific types of clothing. Whether they wear cowboy hats, trucker hats, or something else entirely, today's truckers are free to choose the clothing that they feel is best suited for their job.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p><strong>Cowboy boots are one of the best types of footwear for truckers. While some people assume that it's illegal to wear cowboy boots while you're driving a big rig, that's not actually the case. In fact, the right boots will protect a driver's feet while providing them with comfort and support.</strong></p><p><strong>If a trucker invests in the right pair of cowboy boots, they'll be able to rely on those shoes for years. Whether they opt to pair those boots with a cowboy hat or just wear them with a t-shirt and jeans, leather cowboy boots are a practical footwear choice that still has plenty of style.</strong></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
