When comparing footwear, it helps to know what makes them different from one another.</p><p>This is especially the case when comparing cowboy boots with dress shoes. Whether you need function over form, or vice-versa, in this article, we’ll go into detail on what sets cowboy boots apart from their fancier dress shoe cousins.</p><h2><strong>When should you wear cowboy boots instead of dress shoes?</strong></h2><p><strong>Pick cowboy boots if you’ll be spending a lot of time outdoors.</strong></p><p>Ever since their inception in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, cowboy boots have been made primarily for comfort, safety, and durability.</p><p>Considering the rugged environments they had to endure at the time (and still do today), cowboy boots can last up to a <a href="https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/how-long-do-cowboy-boots-last/">whopping 10 years</a> or more due to the leather they’re made of.</p><p>Cheaper brands, of course, will last less than that, but will still provide the same function and reliability in the short term.</p><p>Now, it’s easy to see why you wouldn’t wear dress shoes on the ranch in place of boots. For work like that, you’ll need something tough enough for the job.</p><p>Cowboy boots can <em>also</em> be used for formal events, provided you’re in the right place. Specifically, you’d choose cowboy boots over dress shoes if the formal event has a strong western theme to it.</p><h2><strong>Do boots count as dress shoes?</strong></h2><p><strong>No, they don’t.</strong></p><p>With that being said, it’s possible to get a fancy pair of "dress cowboy boots," but many agree that boots are more <a href="https://moralcode.com/can-i-wear-boots-with-a-suit/">casual</a> than dress shoes. For most formal events, go with dress shoes unless you’re expected to wear western things.</p><p>Boots are also very different from dress shoes structure-wise. A boot, by standard definition, is defined as <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/boot">a fitted covering (as of leather or rubber) for the foot that usually reaches above the ankle</a>.</p><p>Shoes in this light have a shorter construction, with most having little to no ankle support depending on the type.</p><h2><strong>What similarities do cowboy boots and dress shoes share?</strong></h2><p><strong>Both are fairly durable.</strong></p><p>Similar to cowboy boots, dress shoes can last a long time, especially if the shoe in question is made of leather. However, not all styles of dress shoes are the same. The more durable varieties include:</p><ul><li>Derby</li><li>Oxfords</li><li>Loafers</li><li>Brogues</li></ul><p>Each of these types are “hand-stitched” and typically made of the same stuff that quality cowboy boots are. When quality stitching and leather are combined, you’re sure to get durable footwear no matter the style.</p><h2><strong>What differences do cowboy boots and dress shoes have?</strong></h2><p><strong>Many.</strong></p><p>Considering their purpose, cowboy boots are incredibly different from dress shoes. Whereas boots are better at function, waterproofness, and safety, dress shoes have the advantage of being more comfortable, more breathable, more fashionable, and slightly more versatile than their western-style cousins.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, if the function you’re attending requires you to be outdoors a lot, stick with cowboy boots as they will protect your feet way better than any dress shoe can.</p><p>They don’t necessarily have to be of the cowboy variety either, as several kinds of <a href="https://moralcode.com/can-i-wear-boots-with-a-suit/">dress boots</a> also exist.</p><p>When it comes to fashion, dress shoes are simply better in that department due to the huge variety of forms they come in.</p><p>This can also allow the wearer to look good in more types of environments than any pair of cowboy boots can.</p><h2><strong>How do cowboy boots and dress shoes compare in comfortability?</strong></h2><p><strong>Dress shoes tend to be a bit better for this.</strong></p><p>This is partly due to the freedom your ankles get when wearing dress shoes. With this feature, you get better footing, allowing you to avoid a nasty dislocation or ankle sprain.</p><p>With cowboy boots, you may be able to tuck your pants into the ankle covers should the need arise, but if you’re not used to wearing boots, you can expect your feet to develop blisters after a while.</p><p>This situation is all the more likely if the cowboy boots in question have tapered heels and narrow toes.</p><p>Another factor to consider is the breathability of cowboy boots and dress shoes.</p><p>Not only do dress shoes have more room for your legs and feet to cool off, but they tend to be made of less “water-resistant” materials, which is what cowboy boots need to protect the wearer from water and heat.</p><h2><strong>How do cowboy boots and dress shoes compare in price?</strong></h2><p><strong>Dress shoes will be more expensive overall, whereas cowboy boots are more expensive on average.</strong></p><p>Some dress shoes can reach up to the <a href="https://www.harryrosen.com/en/product/tom-ford-elkan-whole-cut-oxfords-20058184?gclid=CjwKCAjw_tWRBhAwEiwALxFPocC9t8xl66GZuDn1UK1zYc4Ds0ew9YsAmaEWkSEZWIZ0wEkS52oMRhoCpwYQAvD_BwE">thousands of dollars</a> depending on which pair you want to buy.</p><p>However, such pairs are top-of-the-line, whereas more casual dress shoes will typically range around <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Dress+shoes&amp;crid=2ENC8GDF5GPS5&amp;sprefix=dress+shoe%2Caps%2C132&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">50 dollars</a> for a decent pair.</p><p>When it comes to the average cost of cowboy boots, a quality pair will usually be more expensive.</p><p>Want a pair that will last you a decade or longer? Be prepared to dish out <a href="https://horseracingsense.com/how-much-is-a-good-pair-of-cowboy-boots/">200 to 1000</a> dollars. This depends, of course, which brand you go with, and other types of cowboy boots out there can be as little as 50 dollars.</p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>Cowboy boots won’t fit for every occasion, but neither will dress shoes. Now that you have a bit more knowledge than before, pick whatever suits your footwear needs best.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
