Your mind starts racing with all kinds of clothes that you can choose.</p><p>There’s a nice tuxedo hanging in your closet, and a pair of cowboy boots to match.</p><p>Although, is pairing the two a good idea? In this article, we’ll take a look at the finer details of a tuxedo and boot combination, the dos and don’ts of wearing them, and some alternatives in the odd case that the attire you have in mind simply won’t work.</p><h2><strong>Should you wear cowboy boots while wearing a tuxedo?</strong></h2><p><strong>It depends on where you’re going.</strong></p><p>If the host of the event makes a strict note to <em>not</em> wear cowboy boots and/or a tuxedo, then choose another kind of outfit all-together. The question, however, is not so much if you<em> should</em> wear the combo or not, but if you can pull it off in the first place.</p><p>Generally, Tuxedos are known to be a special type of formal wear that require specific kinds of shoes. Anything from classy Oxfords to <a href="https://bespokeunit.com/suits/tuxedos/shoes/">Calvin Klein Bernards</a> are considered more appropriate matches for tuxedo suits. This isn’t to say that you <em>can’t</em> wear cowboy boots at all when rocking a tux, just know that other kinds of footwear might be more appropriate depending on the event you’re attending.</p><p>If you want to try the tux and cowboy boot combination anyway, the number one thing you should avoid is bright colors, especially if certain accessories are in contrast to one another. For example, if your tuxedo is black, <em>don’t</em> pair it with bright red boots. Instead, have your footwear match your suit. Black boots, especially polished to a sleek glossy shine, will pair best with a black tuxedo.</p><p>If it’s available near you, the best match for cowboy boots is the famous <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-western-tuxedo/">western tuxedo</a>.</p><p>Prominent figures such as former US President George Bush Sr. were known to rock this combination in public.</p><p>To do this yourself, it’s important to take a detailed look at what’s considered the full western tuxedo appearance. In addition to your cowboy boots, you may also need a black cowboy hat and an over-sized belt buckle.</p><p>Also, putting on a pair of "boot-cut" jeans on top of all that wouldn’t be a bad idea either. If the western appearance is your ideal go-to, then it doesn’t hurt to go all out with it.</p><p>However, this get-up might not be appropriate for all formal gatherings. However, if you live in the southern US or a similar area, then don’t worry about wearing a tux and cowboy boots.</p><h2><strong>When should you consider wearing cowboy boots with a tuxedo?</strong></h2><p><strong>Location, location, location.</strong></p><p>This will sound like a repeated piece of advice, but <em>where</em> the event is being held can make all the difference in what you pick to wear. If the event you’re attending is a formal wedding, and it has no western themes to speak of, then it’s best that you pick other kinds of footwear other than cowboy boots.</p><p>Another example would be attending a fancy ball. The cultural clash of western and classy gala won’t mix well, and you’ll be getting the wrong kind of attention. If necessary, study the local fashion of where you’ll be going. You’re dressing to impress after all.</p><p>However, if you’re in <a href="https://rmkshoes.com/can-you-wear-cowboy-boots-with-a-suit/">Texas</a> or anywhere similar, then wearing both the tux and boots might be <em>expected</em>. For formal events in these areas, it’s common to have a <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/western-tuxedo-etiquette/">"black tie and boots"</a> dress code.</p><p>Remember the earlier advice recommending you avoid using bright colors? Well, it can matter, especially with men wearing slick tuxedos and polished cowboy boots. That’s right, these kinds of events expect your boots to shine like a brand-new mirror. So, regardless of which cowboy boots you pick to wear, give them a solid cleaning and polish before you head out.</p><h2><strong>What brand of boots goes well with a black tuxedo?</strong></h2><p><strong>There are many types, but the more important thing is giving your footwear a clean look.</strong></p><p>To be even more specific, polish your boots so well that you can see your face in them better than in your bathroom mirror. For any small scratches, you might be able to use <a href="https://bespokeunit.com/suits/tuxedos/shoes/">shoe cream</a> as a quick-fix, but if your footwear is made of other materials besides calfskin, it’ll be much harder to buff out any unsightly marks.</p><p>To compliment the tuxedo look, especially a western-style, consider getting a pair of boots made from <a href="https://rmkshoes.com/can-you-wear-cowboy-boots-with-a-suit/">cowhide, caiman, or lizard</a>. Bonus points if you can find any in glossy black.</p><p>It’s also recommended that you avoid using any brown cowboy boots. The reasoning goes back to when we talked about the need to avoid bright colors. The exception in this case would be pairing them with a nice brown tuxedo to match. What we’re trying to avoid are things that contrast and stand out to one another. It’s better if you match the tux and boot colors.</p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>So, as a quick recap, don’t ignore the possibility that you’ll need different footwear altogether, avoid bright colors, and match your boots with whatever tux you decide on using. Accessories such as a tie should match the boots and suit as well.</p><p>Whatever you choose, keep a clean appearance. Don’t be afraid to add a bit of extra polish and elbow grease as well.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
