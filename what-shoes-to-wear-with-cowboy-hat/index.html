It is most common to wear boots with a cowboy hat, especially if they are cowboy boots.</strong></p><p><strong>However, it is also fashionable to wear dress shoes or casual shoes with one, just not sandals. It greatly depends on the occasion. For more information on this subject, keep reading this article.</strong></p><h2>How to match cowboy hat to boots</h2><p><strong>Is this important? In actuality, yes; but many people fail to do this, and they survive just fine.</strong></p><p><strong>Nobody really notices. Ideally though, you should wear a hat that matches your boots. Would you like some examples?</strong></p><p><strong>Keep reading!</strong></p><p>If it is a formal occasion, you want your hat and boot color to go with your suit jacket and pants.</p><p><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/grey-suit-with-cowboy-boots/">They can either be a match or a complimentary contrasting color. In either case, you will want your hat and boots to match for the best look.</a></p><p>Technically, the material of the hat and boots should also match.</p><p>For instance, if you are wearing a suede cowboy hat, you would be best off wearing suede cowboy boots. People don't always pay attention to this rule.</p><p>Â </p><h2>Can you wear a cowboy hat with shoes?</h2><p><strong>It depends on whom you are dressing for. There are some purists who feel that wearing anything other than boots with a cowboy hat is a sin. The rest of the public does not feel this way and tends to ignore the purists.</strong></p><p><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/black-suit-with-brown-cowboy-boots/">In essence, yes you can wear shoes with a cowboy hat; but the type of shoes you wear is relevant.</a></p><p>You can wear a nice pair of dress shoes and look extremely handsome. As we already mentioned though, wearing sandals is a no-no.</p><p>If you are working or riding on a horse when wearing a cowboy hat, nobody will give you flack if you wear sneakers. <a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/what-are-the-best-jeans-to-wear-with-cowboy-boots/">You may look a little silly that way, but who cares if you are comfortable in them?</a> Wear sneakers or shoes if you want!</p><h2>Are there specific fashion rules for wearing dress shoes with a cowboy hat?</h2><p><strong>Once again, it depends on the occasion.</strong></p><p><strong>If it is a formal event, dress shoes should be worn. If the person would rather wear boots, then a dressy pair of cowboy boots is appropriate and looks fine to others.</strong></p><p>Another factor is where the person is. In much of American nowadays, a cowboy hat is seldom worn. <a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/do-you-tuck-your-pants-in-cowboy-boots/">If someone in the northeastern United States is wearing one, they will likely be mocked.</a> Of course, if they are in either the west or southwest, it is common and revered.</p><p>Your best bet is to wear shoes with a material and a color to match your cowboy hat.</p><p><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/do-you-tuck-your-pants-in-cowboy-boots/">This is extremely fashionable, and you will look quite dashing.</a></p><h2>Do you have to wear boots with a cowboy hat?</h2><p><strong>While it is not illegal not to wear the boots; fashion mavens insist that boots are a must if you are going to wear the cowboy hat.</strong></p><p><strong>Consider this! If you are wearing a black cowboy hat with black dress boots, you will look sensational. Especially if the hat and boots are made of leather or another fine material.</strong></p><p><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/do-you-tuck-your-pants-in-cowboy-boots/">If you do not have a pair of boots, then a slick-looking pair of dress shoes of a similar style to the hat will do fine.</a></p><p>A more formal appearance will be achieved by wearing cowboy boots with a cowboy hat.</p><p>Please note, if you are wearing a boot of any other type than a cowboy boot when you are wearing a cowboy hat, some people might think you look ridiculous. <a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/can-you-wear-a-fedora-with-cowboy-boots/">However, if you don't care what those people think, go ahead and wear them.</a></p><h2>What about women?</h2><p><strong>Generally the same fashion rules apply to a woman wearing shoes with a cowgirl hat as they do for men.</strong></p><p><strong>It depends on where she is as well as the occasion. Again, if she lives in the west or southwest, it is appropriate for her to wear a cowgirl hat. In that case, if she wants to wear shoes with it, dressier kinds look best.</strong></p><p>On the other hand, if she lives anyplace else, she might look rather silly in a cowgirl hat. However, the United States is a free country. So, if she chooses to wear one anyhow, that is her right and nobody will ever stop her.</p><p><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/grey-suit-with-cowboy-boots/">As with the men, if a woman wants to appear as a fashion plate, she should wear cowgirl boots with a cowgirl hat.</a> She should try to match the colors and material types for the best look possible.</p><h2>Where is it normal to wear a cowboy hat?</h2><p><strong>As we have been alluding to, this completely depends on where he is and the occasion. If a man of the west is attending a formal occasion, then wearing a cowboy hat with his attire IS dressing up. In this case, he would wear an especially fine hat. Chances are he owns a number of cowboy hats anyhow, one for each purpose.</strong></p><p>It is also prudent to wear one while performing his cowboy duties on the range or a ranch. Normally, this would be while riding his or her horse. <a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/do-you-tuck-your-pants-in-cowboy-boots/">In such a case, he should wear work-oriented cowboy boots with the rest of his outfit.</a></p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p><strong>Keep in mind, even at casual events but especially at formal ones, it is proper etiquette to remove the hat upon entering the building or room.</strong></p><p><strong>This is true of any type of hat in addition to a cowboy one. It is also okay to wear shoes when wearing the cowboy hat as long as they are meant for that level of formality.</strong></p><p><strong>Again, this is a free country. If you want to wear the shoes with the hat, go right ahead!</strong></p><p>Â </p><p>Â </p></div><aside class="post__sidebar post__sidebar--left"><div class="sidebar sidebar--sticky"><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Share on:</h3><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhat-shoes-to-wear-with-cowboy-hat%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhat-shoes-to-wear-with-cowboy-hat%2F&amp;via=Texas%20Walkabout&amp;text=What%20shoes%20to%20wear%20with%20cowboy%20hat%20(Explained)" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhat-shoes-to-wear-with-cowboy-hat%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=What%20shoes%20to%20wear%20with%20cowboy%20hat%20(Explained)" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pinterest </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhat-shoes-to-wear-with-cowboy-hat%2F" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mix </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhat-shoes-to-wear-with-cowboy-hat%2F" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=What%20shoes%20to%20wear%20with%20cowboy%20hat%20(Explained)&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhat-shoes-to-wear-with-cowboy-hat%2F" class="js-share buffer" title="Share with Buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Buffer </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=What%20shoes%20to%20wear%20with%20cowboy%20hat%20(Explained) https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fwhat-shoes-to-wear-with-cowboy-hat%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp</a></div></section><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Tagged in:</h3><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/" title="Cowboy Boots">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/" title="Western Wear">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div></section><nav class="sidebar__item post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Previous post:</h3><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/grey-suit-with-cowboy-boots/" rel="next">5 Things To Know About Wearing A Grey suit with cowboy boots</a></div></nav></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__author"><div><h3 class="h6"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/authors/texas-walkabout/" rel="author">Texas Walkabout</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><div class="post__related"><h3>Related post</h3><div class="l-grid"><article class="c-card c-card--compact"><div class="c-card__body"><header><h2 class="c-card__title c-card__title--compact"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/sports-coat-with-jeans-and-cowboy-boots/">7 Tips For Wearing A Sports Coat With Jeans And Cowboy BootsÂ </a></h2></header><div class="metadata c-card__metadata c-card__metadata--compact"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/" class="metadata__maintag">Cowboy Boots</a> <a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/authors/texas-walkabout/" class="metadata__author">Texas Walkabout</a> <time datetime="2022-03-06T11:20" class="metadata__date">03.06.2022</time></div></div></article><article class="c-card c-card--compact"><div class="c-card__body"><header><h2 class="c-card__title c-card__title--compact"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/do-pants-go-over-or-under-cowboy-boots/">Do pants go over or under cowboy boots?
