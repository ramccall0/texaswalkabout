For a formal event, you can wear dress boots that are made out of black leather or brown leather with a nice shine. If you want to add some more personality to your outfit, try some boots that are made out of a different material such as gator or ostrich.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>You don't want your boots to be too cowboy-like, such as those that feature intricate stitching or large metal decorations on them. This would make your outfit seem more like something you'd wear when out on the town on the weekend rather than something for work or a formal event. You also don't want to go for any boots that have a toe that is too rounded or pointed. You want to aim for something in the middle where it will look good but also still give you comfort when you're wearing it.</p><p></p><p></p><p>There are several different places where you can get these types of boots from, such as stores in big malls and even online stores. You'll find many different brands and styles when you shop around so it is important to take some time and find the best pair available to fit your needs.</p><p></p><p></p><hr class="wp-block-separator"><p></p><h2><strong>Can you wear brown cowboy boots with black suit?</strong></h2><p></p><p></p><p>Wearing a suit to the office is pretty standard, yet you can further dress it up by wearing cowboy boots. You can also make a cowboy boots with suit combination work for casual events.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It will depend on the occasion, your location and the venue. If you are heading to a bar or nightclub, then you can wear any style of cowboy boots. If you are headed to an upscale party at a nice country club, then be sure to wear dress boots with your suit.</p><p></p><p></p><hr class="wp-block-separator"><p></p><h2><strong>Can you wear cowboy boots to the office?</strong></h2><p></p><p></p><p>In the modern work environment, most people dress up to varying degrees. Women tend to wear dresses or skirts with nice tops, while men often wear nice slacks with a dress shirt and tie. In the business world, there are always some people who stand out by dressing too informally for the occasion.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A pair of cowboy boots can be a great way to draw attention to yourself if you're aiming for that kind of effect — but what about if you're trying to fit in? Cowboy boots are associated with cowboys, which is an occupation that doesn't exactly scream "corporate professional."</p><p></p><p></p><p>However, this doesn't mean that cowboy boots have no place in a business setting. The key is dressing them up a bit so they don't look too casual. If you want to wear cowboy boots at the office, make sure they're dark brown or black and made from soft leather. Avoid things that look like they'd be more appropriate on a ranch than in an office building. Leave your jeans and cowboy hats at home unless you're headed straight from work to a country music concert.</p><p></p><p></p><hr class="wp-block-separator"><p></p><h2>Can cowboy boots be considered dress shoes?</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Cowboy boots are definitely able to be considered dress shoes. You see in the wild west cowboys used to wear them all the time, but then they became a part of the country's culture and were worn by many people.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Boot makers started to make nicer versions of them and now they are a part of any fashion conscious man's wardrobe. Cowboy boots have a lot of fashion history behind them, and can be considered dress shoes if you get a nice pair that's not worn and old.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The best brands to go for really expensive cowboy boots from are Lucchese, which is an American brand that makes very high quality boots. They're very expensive but if you can afford it then they're worth getting because of their quality. For the more affordable version, try getting a pair from Tony Lama who makes some good boots at decent prices. If you'd like to go even cheaper than that, there are plenty of places online where you can get cheap ones as well.</p><p></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 18, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://ramccall0.github.io/texaswalkabout/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://ramccall0.github.io/texaswalkabout/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Framccall0.github.io%2Ftexaswalkabout%2Fcowboy-boots-with-suit%2F" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://ramccall0.github.io/texaswalkabout/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Framccall0.github.io%2Ftexaswalkabout%2Fcowboy-boots-with-suit%2F&amp;via=Texas%20Walkabout&amp;text=Cowboy%20Boots%20With%20Suit%20%7C%20Can%20It%20Be%20Done%3F" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://ramccall0.github.io/texaswalkabout/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Framccall0.github.io%2Ftexaswalkabout%2Fcowboy-boots-with-suit%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=Cowboy%20Boots%20With%20Suit%20%7C%20Can%20It%20Be%20Done%3F" class="js-share pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://ramccall0.github.io/texaswalkabout/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> <span>Pinterest</span> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Framccall0.github.io%2Ftexaswalkabout%2Fcowboy-boots-with-suit%2F" class="js-share mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://ramccall0.github.io/texaswalkabout/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> <span>Mix</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Framccall0.github.io%2Ftexaswalkabout%2Fcowboy-boots-with-suit%2F" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://ramccall0.github.io/texaswalkabout/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Cowboy%20Boots%20With%20Suit%20%7C%20Can%20It%20Be%20Done%3F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Framccall0.github.io%2Ftexaswalkabout%2Fcowboy-boots-with-suit%2F" class="js-share buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://ramccall0.github.io/texaswalkabout/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#buffer"/></svg> <span>Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Cowboy%20Boots%20With%20Suit%20%7C%20Can%20It%20Be%20Done%3F https%3A%2F%2Framccall0.github.io%2Ftexaswalkabout%2Fcowboy-boots-with-suit%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://ramccall0.github.io/texaswalkabout/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://ramccall0.github.io/texaswalkabout/authors/texas-walkabout/" class="invert" rel="author">Texas Walkabout</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://ramccall0.github.io/texaswalkabout/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://ramccall0.github.io/texaswalkabout/what-color-cowboy-hat-to-wear-with-brown-boots/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> What color cowboy hat to wear with brown boots?
