Today, there are many different styles of boots on the market, including boots with rubber soles.</p><p class="p1">While both types of boots have their advantages, leather soles don't provide a lot of grip. If you've noticed that your boots seem to be slippery, you don't have to get used to it. There are ways to add traction to the soles of your boots so that you can wear them without slipping.</p><h2 class="p2"><strong>Why Are Cowboy Boots so Slippery?</strong></h2><p class="p1">Cowboy boots aren't always slippery, but your boots may not have much traction if they have leather outsoles. Even when leather soles are designed to be slip-resistant, the smooth texture of the soles keeps them from gripping the surface that you're walking across.</p><p class="p1">Rubber soles are designed to produce friction as you walk. Thanks to this, cowboy boots with rubber soles usually aren't that slippery. With that said, if you've already invested in a pair of boots with leather soles, you don't have to keep slipping and sliding as you walk. There are steps you can take that will give your boots a little more grip.</p><h2 class="p2"><strong>How Do I Make My Cowboy Boots Less Slippery?</strong></h2><p class="p1">Wearing your cowboy boots regularly will scuff the soles of the shoes, giving you more traction. If you're looking for a quicker solution to this issue, you could scuff the soles yourself using an abrasive material, like sandpaper. You could also try adding grip pads to the bottom of your soles.</p><p class="p1">Later down the road, when you're ready to re-sole your boots, you could also ask the cobbler to replace your old leather sole with a new rubber sole. You could even opt for a hybrid sole, which combines leather and rubber. High-quality cowboy boots are designed to last for years, and even if you're not completely satisfied with your boots, there are plenty of ways to improve them.</p><h2 class="p2"><strong>Are Cowboy Boots Supposed to Slip?</strong></h2><p class="p1">Cowboy boots were originally designed for workers that ride horses. Wearing boots with slippery leather soles made it easier to mount and dismount horses. Rubber soles, which provide more traction, can easily get stuck on stirrups when riding.</p><p class="p1">Wearing boots with very smooth soles can also be an advantage while line dancing. If you're working, it might be frustrating when your feet slide across the floor as you move. When you're dancing, however, smooth soles can make it easier to complete steps. In fact, some line dancers don't wear their boots outside so that the soles will stay as smooth as possible.</p><p class="p1">Even though people from all walks of life wear cowboy boots today, there are still advantages to wearing boots with slippery leather soles. Leather is comfortable, breathable, and naturally conforms to the shape of your foot. If you don't need footwear with extra traction, leather-soled boots can be a terrific option.</p><h2 class="p2"><strong>How Do You Put Traction on Cowboy Boots?</strong></h2><p class="p1">Cowboy boots with leather soles will naturally become more slip-resistant over time, especially if you wear them on rough surfaces like concrete. You can also scuff up the soles of your boots yourself with sandpaper or a nail file, but you should take care not to damage the shoes in the process.</p><p class="p1">If you're looking for a safer way to get the grip that you need, the best thing you can do is take your boots to a cobbler. A cobbler can apply a thin grip finish to the soles of your boots, instantly giving you more traction. If you'd prefer to do things yourself, there are also rubber grips that you can add to your soles at home.</p><h2 class="p2"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p class="p1">Cowboy boots aren't always slippery, but boots with smooth leather soles might not provide enough traction for the average user. If you're in the market for a pair of cowboy boots, and you want something slip-resistant, you should look for rubber-soled boots that have great grip.</p><p class="p1">If you have cowboy boots with leather soles, and you want to make them less slippery, you have plenty of options. Leather soles may not provide the traction that rubber soles do, but you can get more grip by scuffing up your soles or applying a stick-on grip. You don't necessarily have to replace your cowboy boots if you're not happy with them. There are plenty of ways to adapt your boots to your needs.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
