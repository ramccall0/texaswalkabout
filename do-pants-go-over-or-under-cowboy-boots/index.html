Gals want to show off their boots to friends and peers, so it’s more appropriate to prominently display their cowgirl boots in public. Doing so is easier as opposed to guys doing the same things, as gals can opt out of jeans for a nice-looking dress.</p><p>For guys, it’s more appropriate to wear jeans on the <em>outside</em> of their cowboy boots. The reason being is that the pant legs don’t become too crinkled overtime.</p><h2><strong>How do you hide cowboy boots under jeans?</strong></h2><p><strong>It depends on the jeans.</strong></p><p>If you wish to hide your stylish cowboy boots for any reason, focus on the kinds of jeans you wear with them. A common type to consider is boot-cut jeans. These are typically 17 to 20 inches long at the leg openings, and are able to hide your boots from sticking out too much. Just as the name of them suggests, boot-cut jeans are made for wearing cowboy boots!</p><p>If you can’t find a pair, don’t worry, there’s still a few options you can try. These include using jeans that are fairly long, and ensuring the color is the same (or at the very least, similar) as your cowboy boots. Extra length can also make the overall look more rugged in nature, which most guys love!</p><p>For gals, skinny jeans can work too. As these kinds are thin, you can simply wear boots over them. If you want to keep jeans on the outside for any reason, it’s better to find boots that are thin as well, as thick openings on the boots will make your jeans look puffed out and strange.</p><p>Most cowboy boots are made to be long, so any jeans you pick to match with them can work just as long as they’re not too short or too thin. This process can be a bit tricky, so give your shoe width size a good look, or ask a boot store employee to measure your size using a guiding chart.</p><h2><strong>Do you tuck your pants in your cowboy boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>Unless you’re doing dirty work, then no.</strong></p><p>If you plan on going out to show others your western-style, then avoid tucking your pants into your cowboy boots. Formal occasions are intended for people to dress their best. Tucking in your jeans will create unsightly folds and creases that everyone will see. Unless you’re horse-riding or doing muddy work out on a ranch, keep your jeans on the outside.</p><p>With that being said, an exception is for the gals with skinny jeans. As mentioned earlier, some boots look better with the jeans tucked in.</p><h2><strong>Why would you tuck your jeans underneath your boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>You’d do so for dirty work or for style.</strong></p><p>When doing work out on a farm or ranch, it’s a good idea to tuck your jeans into your cowboy boots. Doing so will prevent mud, dirt, and other nasty things from staining your clothes.</p><p>This is especially important for those that ride horses a lot. When riding, water and mud puddles will be a constant threat, and tucking in your jeans will prevent them from getting wet and dirty. It’s also recommended to get narrow-cut “Western jeans” paired with “roper” boots, as both of these items are better designed for the outdoors.</p><p>Again, sometimes cowboy boots are too wide to fit underneath your pant legs, so tucking them in <em>may</em> be necessary. Check yourself in the mirror before heading out though.</p><h2><strong>Why would you leave your jeans over your boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>For style!</strong></p><p>Itching to try out your new cowboy boots at a local fair? Wear your jeans on the outside! Doing so may not show off your full western-prowess, but it will look nicer overall. In fact, most men are <em>expected</em> to wear their jeans over boots in most formal gatherings.</p><p>However, if there’s a lot of rain and mud at the event, then most (if not all) people won’t bat an eye if you decide to tuck your jeans in.</p><p>Gals can wear jeans overtop too, just as long as it looks stylish to themselves and their peers. If possible, for either gender, use a pair of jeans that are just wide enough at the bottom so the boots don’t puff out the pant legs too much.</p><h2><strong>How do you wear pants with cowboy boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>Just about any way you want!</strong></p><p>There’s no straight answer to this question. Just wear them in a way that’s comfortable, and doesn’t look too weird. Some might prefer to wear the tightest jeans you can imagine and pair them with the widest boots on the market, and others might choose boot-cut jeans with their toes barely sticking out.</p><p>However, for those that want to tuck in their jeans without sacrificing style, there’s a smart technique you can use.

Remember that <em>both</em> style and function matter.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
