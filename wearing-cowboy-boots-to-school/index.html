You’d like to try wearing cowboy boots to your classes, but aren’t sure if that’s a good idea. Are they practical, or are they even in <i>style</i>? To give students a boost of confidence, no matter what kind of school they go to (high school, college, university, whatever!) we’ll discuss some cowboy boot facts and how you can pull the look off.</p><hr><h2 class="p1"><strong>How do you wear cowboy boots without looking country? It depends on what <i>else</i> you wear with them.</strong></h2><p class="p1">Putting on the first pair of cowboy boots you’ve ever worn won’t immediately make you look like you just came out of a country music concert (but if that’s your thing, go for it!). Pulling off a certain look can also mean what <a href="https://rmkshoes.com/wear-cowboy-boots-without-looking-country/"><span class="s1">other kinds of clothes</span></a> you wear with your boots as well. You need not dash over to the mall for anything new, either. Pieces of clothing such as t-shirts or even <a href="https://rmkshoes.com/wear-cowboy-boots-without-looking-country/"><span class="s1">khakis</span></a> can go nicely with cowboy boots.</p><p class="p1">Another good piece of advice is to wear them with <a href="https://rmkshoes.com/wear-cowboy-boots-without-looking-country/"><span class="s1">confidence</span></a>. It’s not so much what you wear, but a lot more about <i>how</i>.</p><hr><h2 class="p1"><strong>Can you wear boots to school? If you want!</strong></h2><p class="p1">As long as your institution <a href="https://www.quora.com/Can-I-wear-long-boots-to-school"><span class="s1">dress code</span></a> allows it, go ahead! The question you should be asking yourself is not <i>can</i> you, but <i>will</i> you?</p><p class="p1">Just to be absolutely sure though, check your school rules. If you don’t notice anything mentioning that “cowboy boots” specifically aren’t allowed in any way, shape or manner, then it should be okay to bring them with you.</p><hr><h2 class="p1"><strong>Are cowboy boots in style? Yep!</strong></h2><p class="p1">When trying to wear them with “style,” pick a combination of clothes that feels both comfortable and awesome to you. Part of achieving the “how” of wearing any outfit includes fabric that doesn’t bother your skin, and a look that looks good to <i>you</i> in the mirror.</p><p class="p1">If you don’t have a good idea despite trial and error, you might find your style in any of these 2022 guides both for <a href="https://bootspy.com/what-do-cowboy-boots-say-about-a-man/"><span class="s1">men</span></a> and <a href="https://www.purewow.com/fashion/how-to-wear-cowboy-boots"><span class="s1">women</span></a>. These are what’s considered most popular currently, and fashion trends come and go, but cowboy boots seem to stand the test of time.</p><hr><h2 class="p1"><strong>Can you wear cowboy boots casually? By wearing casual things.</strong></h2><p class="p1">No real rocket science for this one, just pick a <a href="https://www.ariat.com/al/what-to-wear-with-cowboy-boots"><span class="s1">common piece of clothing</span></a> to go along with your chosen pair of cowboy boots. Even wearing a t-shirt and jean combo can complement the footwear.</p><hr><h2 class="p1"><strong>Can you wear cowboy boots every day? Why not?</strong></h2><p class="p1">As we’ve established, cowboy boots are still comfortable and appropriate for just about any place you go. Those who wear cowboy boots seven days a week like to keep <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboyboots/comments/8ema4r/how_many_of_you_wear_your_boots_everyday/"><span class="s1">an extra pair</span></a> at all times so they can cycle through to prevent too much wear and tear.</p><hr><h2 class="p1"><strong>Can you wear cowboy boots anywhere? Sure can!</strong></h2><p class="p1">Going a bit more in-depth, the answer to wearing anything in any environment lies strongly in the <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Wear-Cowboy-Boots"><span class="s1">how</span></a>. Be warned, though, that going <i>too</i> country might send the wrong message (unless that’s your intent). Avoiding clothing that contrasts too differently with each other might be a good idea as well.</p><p class="p1">What also helps, again, is maintaining your own confidence. First learn to feel comfortable, then feel good about your choice of outfit, enter the public sphere.</p><hr><h2 class="p1"><strong>Is it weird to wear cowboy boots in the summer? No, not really.</strong></h2><p class="p1">Considering how tough leather <a href="https://durabilitymatters.com/how-long-does-real-leather-last/"><span class="s1">is</span></a>, it can be used for just about any outdoor weather. If you grab the right kind of pair, such as a <a href="https://harrysboots.com/how-to-wear-cowboy-boots-in-summer/"><span class="s1">sandal replacement</span></a> or even a work boot, you’ll have both comfort <i>and</i> style on your side.</p><p class="p1">That is, of course, if you choose to go with something that stands out, especially the “western” look, it might not be appropriate for all scenarios. Work boots should be worn at work and hardly anywhere else, for example. Don’t wear short and highly breathable cowboy boots when it’s raining outside, as another example.</p><hr><h2 class="p1"><strong>Bonus content: other things to consider.</strong></h2><p class="p1">It might be tempting, but <a href="https://rmkshoes.com/wear-cowboy-boots-without-looking-country/"><span class="s1">avoid</span></a> tucking your jeans into those wide cowboy boots. This is usually done for wandering through thick and dangerous terrain or riding a horse, and can ruin your pant leggings through multiple wrinkles.</p><p class="p1">Also, go with a size that simply <i>feels</i> comfortable to walk in. You’re going to wear cowboy boots like shoes for hours on end, so finding the pair that feels right will increase your confidence levels as well. To add to that, keep in mind that so, so many <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Wear-Cowboy-Boots"><span class="s1">styles</span></a> of cowboy boots exist out there. Aim to feel <i>and</i> look great (in the mirror first, of course).</p><p class="p1">Again, confidence, confidence, <i>confidence.</i> As we’ve covered <a href="https://rmkshoes.com/wear-cowboy-boots-without-looking-country/"><span class="s1">before</span></a>, in addition to finding some comfortable footwear, keep a straight posture and walk like you know where you’re going.</p><p class="p1">Confidence in itself will usually surface the more you practice it, just like any skill. When you go to the gym, you lift weights, tearing muscle tissue, and your body repairs any damage to make it stronger and larger over time (eat good food if you decide to do this!). The same applies for non-physical skills, such as mental.</p><hr><h2 class="p1"><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2><p class="p1">All in all, pick what you want. Cowboy boots are a fun thing to try, not a mandatory one.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
