You want to be prepared. You have your weapons, your schedule, food and supplies all ready to go. Yet, what about those pair of cowboy boots in your closet? They’re quite reliable and stylish, but will they be tough enough for the hunts ahead? In this article, we’ll discuss whether you should or shouldn’t wear them while hunting, and what you can do to protect your feet from just about any hunting activity.</p><hr><h2><strong>Are cowboy boots good for hunting?</strong></h2><p><strong>No, not really.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, cowboy boots won’t serve you well in the wilderness when hunting game. This is due to their <a href="https://dresscodehub.com/wear-cowboy-boots-hunting/">intended design</a>, which does not include protecting your feet from long hunts.</p><p>The two major disadvantages cowboy boots have are their lack of grip on the outer soles and poor ankle support. This can be especially problematic if you choose to hunt off the beaten trail.</p><p>Heavily wooded areas or desert can become incredibly slippery during or after a rain. Cowboy boots won’t help you with this, they’re simply not designed for any of that.</p><hr><h2><strong>Should you wear cowboy boots while hunting?</strong></h2><p><strong>You can, but it’s generally not a good idea.</strong></p><p>Even though there are various hunting <a href="https://dsgouterwear.com/blog/blaze-orange-hunting-requirements-by-state-usa/">rules</a> in the US that all hunters must abide by, there’s virtually nothing saying you can’t wear cowboy boots on a hunt if you want to. Therefore, it’s your choice.</p><p>Some people have recommended using <a href="https://www.quora.com/I-live-in-the-Appalachian-region-and-I-hunt-Are-cowgirl-western-boots-good-for-hunting-in-mountains-especially-walking-around-a-lot-trailing-outside-dogs">roper-style</a> cowboy boots over traditional ones, due to their <a href="https://www.westernbootbarn.com.au/blog/the-history-of-cowboy-boots/">lower</a> heel heights. Just in case, make sure any ropers you’re interested in also come with good grip.</p><p>The primary subject here, however, is that it’s a better idea to wear boots for their intended <a href="https://www.idahostatejournal.com/outdoors/xtreme_idaho/yes-you-do-need-different-boots-for-different-activities/article_08fe4796-8969-5b24-bd43-35fbe20bd88f.html">purposes</a>. Going for a hike? Hiking boots. Going on a hunt? Hunting boots, especially for colder weather.</p><p>Ultimately, the choice is yours, but don’t ignore your safety, either. You might be out in the wild for several hours on end. At the very least, cowboy boots can <em>technically</em> work if you walk on open trails, places that aren’t usually affected all too much by weather. Use careful judgement.</p><hr><h2><strong>What boots do you wear for hunting? Boots for hunting.</strong></h2><p>Hunting boots are used for hunting. Many are <a href="https://protips.dickssportinggoods.com/sports-and-activities/hunt-and-fish/learn-about-different-types-of-hunting-boots">specially</a> designed for colder weather, have cleats in addition to heavy rubber grip, high ankles to protect the legs from bites and sharp brush, and insulating layers for sitting still on long winter hunts.</p><p>However, be warned, they have a little extra <a href="https://decideoutside.com/hiking-boots-vs-hunting-boots/">mass</a> than most outdoor shoes and boots. That’s right, <a href="https://www.quora.com/I-live-in-the-Appalachian-region-and-I-hunt-Are-cowgirl-western-boots-good-for-hunting-in-mountains-especially-walking-around-a-lot-trailing-outside-dogs">hiking</a> boots are considered better than cowboy boots when hunting.</p><hr><h2><strong>Do cowboy boots have a purpose? Yep!</strong></h2><p>Ever since their <a href="https://www.westernbootbarn.com.au/blog/the-history-of-cowboy-boots/">inception</a>, cowboy boots have been used to ride horses comfortably and keep their riders secure. From their earlier usage as Spanish horse boots in the 1600s to the modern ones we know of, cowboy boots are also now used for ranching and farming.</p><p>But with it also came a style that people simply enjoy wearing, such as in the 40’s, when the pointed-toed cowboy boot became an American icon. So what’s the purpose of a cowboy boot? Just about anything you want it to be!</p><hr><h2><strong>Are hunting boots necessary? No, not really.</strong></h2><p>Due to how <a href="https://decideoutside.com/hiking-boots-vs-hunting-boots/">safe</a> it is, sticking to the trails in just about any footwear is game. As long as they have <em>some</em> support, like insulating your feet from the cold, then pick any kind of footwear you want!</p><p>Remember that piece of advice earlier, the one about hunting boots having more <a href="https://decideoutside.com/hiking-boots-vs-hunting-boots/">mass</a>? That will add to cost in addition to the extra protection you’ll be getting.</p><p>However, most hunts in general would likely involve some off-terrain traveling. Wearing cowboy boots in the thick muck or woods would get you a sprain sooner than getting your target.</p><p>Let’s not forget about <a href="https://dresscodehub.com/wear-cowboy-boots-hunting/">safety</a>. Harming yourself in the middle of nowhere means you won’t get help for quite a while. Cowboy boots <em>may</em> protect you from a snake bite, but an actual snake boot will do the job better. Use an intended boot for an intended purpose. Can you be a cowboy in the thick wilderness? Not without a horse!</p><p>All in all, you’re your own boss. We’re just discussing what’s best for <em>you</em> in addition to what you prefer.</p><hr><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>Hunting doesn’t always have to be extreme, but with extreme terrain, <a href="https://dresscodehub.com/wear-cowboy-boots-hunting/">hunting</a> boots are best for hunting.</p><p>How long you hunt has a part to play in it too. Perhaps bring another pair of boots with you? Even if your cowboy boots break or can’t get you to where you need to go, then at least you have something extra that you can swap with. Having a variety of tools and tricks will help just about any hunter. Especially when hunting some difficult game.</p><p>Want to go for cowboy boots anyway? By all means! At least you know now that you can make it work, <a href="https://www.quora.com/I-live-in-the-Appalachian-region-and-I-hunt-Are-cowgirl-western-boots-good-for-hunting-in-mountains-especially-walking-around-a-lot-trailing-outside-dogs">somewhat</a>. This isn’t to discourage anyone from trying, but cowboy boots with extra support can make all the difference.</p><p>Regardless of your choices, be prepared for <em>any</em> hunt you decide to go on. Check the weather. Will it be slippery after that storm? Is the area on a steep mountain ridge? Was there a flood on the plains last night? If things get wild, then it’s a good idea to leave any cowboy boots at home.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
