The bottoms of the Levi's 501 jeans are wide enough to fit over your boots without looking ridiculous. It is like the two garments were made specifically for each other. As a point of reference, the same holds true for most other jeans with cowboy boots. The exception is the skinny jeans. Those are meant to be worn on the insides of your boots.</strong></p><hr><h2>Expanding on this thought!</h2><p><strong>Although it is really a matter of personal preference, we have to say that the Levi's 501 jeans tend to be the favorite. If you are just now shopping for a pair of jeans to go with your authentic cowboy boots, the 501s are the style to choose.</strong></p><p>This is the combination you would wear for everyday use. If you are attending a formal event, then you might want to select a pair of skinny jeans that automatically go on the inside of your boots. Top the outfit off with a stylish cowboy hat, and you will catch the eye of everyone else at the event.</p><hr><h2>Should I size up for Levi's 501 jeans?</h2><p><strong>You should already know your true jeans size. If it has been a while or this is your first time buying jeans to go with your cowboy boots, then yes, do size them up. You want them to fit correctly. Some so-called fashion experts think you should buy your jeans small, particularly in the waist. We disagree! We say they should be comfortable and a little loose.</strong></p><p>What is more important to you? Looking perfect in your jeans, or being able to walk and sit down in them. What good is owning the perfect pair of jeans if you are not comfortable in them?</p><hr><h2>What is the key to selecting jeans to go with your cowboy boots?</h2><p><strong>Definitely go with wide-bottomed legs. They will fit properly over your boots and look sensational. When you go to buy your jeans, bring along the boots you intend to wear them with. You want them to hang loosely over the boots. Try on various pairs of jeans until you find one that fits just right.</strong></p><p>What you do not want is the pant legs to be bunched up at the top of your boots. This would look so silly. Does this remind you of someone who has tried that? Didn't he or she look ridiculous? You want a nice tapered look of the jeans over your boots.</p><hr><h2>Can you wear Levi's 505 jeans with cowboy boots?</h2><p><strong>You can try this combination, but don't be surprised if people laugh at you. This is because Levi's 505 are straight-legged jeans. They do not look good tucked into the boots or draped over the outsides of them.</strong></p><p>What happens is every crease of the boots will show underneath the jeans. Not only that, but the tops of your boots will make the jeans stick out at the point of contact. This style of jeans is really not meant to go with cowboy boots.</p><hr><h2>What jeans work with cowboy boots?</h2><p><strong>As we have been discussing, there are many brands and styles of jeans that go splendidly with cowboy boots. There are two ways you can go. One is to wear your jeans with the pant legs hanging loosely over the boots. This is always acceptable.</strong></p><p>The other way is to wear skinny jeans which are automatically tucked into the cowboy boots. If you are wearing a pair of boots that are marvelously crafted and you wish to show them off, skinny jeans will do the trick.</p><p>Your jeans don't have to be Levi's either. There are a number of makers and individual styles you can choose to wear. Always remember to try them on before buying them. The right pair is out there for you.</p><hr><h2>What is the fit of Levi's 501 jeans?</h2><p><strong>Some jeans makers use a stretchy denim, however, most Levi's 501 jeans are created with 100% cotton. They tend to sit tightly around the waist with straight legs and roomy at the thighs.</strong></p><hr><h2>What about Levi's 501-type jeans for women and for kids?</h2><p><strong>Yes, there are such things. They are called Levi's 501 Jeans for Women. There are also Levi's for kids with different style names. All of these varieties of Levi's jeans are designed to be worn with cowboy boots. Unless they are the skinny jeans, they should all hang down over your boots.</strong></p><hr><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p><strong>The most important thing to take away from this article is yes, Levi's 501 jeans can be worn with cowboy boots. This is true of all genders and all age groups. We have even provided advice on how to properly wear this combination. You are all set now!</strong></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
