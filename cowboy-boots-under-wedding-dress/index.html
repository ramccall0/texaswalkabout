Not only does she want her future husband impressed and love-struck with awe by her appearance, she wants the wedding guests to be amazed too!</p><p>In this article, we’ll discuss whether wearing cowboy boots underneath a wedding dress is appropriate, and ways in which the combination can work.</p><h2><strong>Can you wear cowboy boots underneath a wedding dress?</strong></h2><p><strong>Yes you can, just be aware of the terrain!</strong></p><p>The real heart of the issue isn’t whether you <em>can</em> wear cowboy boots to your wedding or not. Just about anyone can wear boots anytime they please. It’s a matter of your personal choices and the environment.</p><p>Let’s talk a bit about practicality.</p><p>If you’re having your wedding in the great outdoors, within a rustic barn, or even nearby horse stables (these are just examples, the style of the wedding is up to you), wearing cowboy boots will not only be theme-appropriate, but will also prevent you from spraining your ankle during the ceremony.</p><p>Traditional wedding footwear such as high-heels won’t function very well on dirt, gravel, mud, or grass.</p><p>If you have to spend large amounts of time outside on rugged terrain during your special event, consider slipping on your best pair of cowboy boots for both function and form.</p><p>Whereas rugged boots might seem more of a masculine approach, keep in mind the ground that you’ll be walking on.</p><p>Nature isn’t known to have smooth, flat surfaces for treading, so it might be a good idea to wear something that will carry you in comfort, especially during an event as important as your wedding.</p><h2><strong>Should you wear cowboy boots underneath a wedding dress?</strong></h2><p><strong>Again, wearing or not wearing them is a matter of choice.</strong></p><p>In our western world, the bride has <em>a huge</em> influence over choosing what goes into a wedding. If you’re already considering wearing cowboy boots for your special day, go ahead!</p><p>Heck, you could even ask all your friends and family to do the same!</p><p>Choosing to wear them is also a matter of confidence. Does it feel fun to wear cowboy boots?</p><p>Do you love country dancing on the dance floor all night long? If any of the previous questions gets you excited, then cowboy boots are a perfect choice!</p><p>You don’t have to be wild and crazy just to appreciate them either. As mentioned earlier, the wedding theme is important too.</p><p>Should the background match, taking pictures with your stylish boots will leave you and your family with fun memories for years to come.</p><p>Another reminder, the ground you’ll be walking on should be considered as well. No bride wants to stumble all over the place because she didn’t wear something functional enough.</p><p>To save yourself from any potential embarrassment (or worse, serious harm), make sure the footwear you choose, cowboy boots or whatever else, is practical enough to serve your wishes.</p><h2><strong>What cowboy boots can go well with a wedding dress?</strong></h2><p><strong>It’s recommended you choose style over function, and there are multiple options to pick from.</strong></p><p>With that being said, at the very least, whatever pair of dress boots you choose, test them on uneven ground should the need arise.</p><p>Even though Lacey boots are more appropriate for weddings, they should come with a degree of toughness as well.</p><p>If you’re willing to go all out on the looks, try shopping for some custom-made boots that the <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=Lucchese+cowboy+boots&amp;linkCode=gs3&amp;linkId=23c75ae5e2be718d98b8c10b83e4865e&amp;tag=asset1048ca00-20">Lucchese</a> brand is well-known for.</p><p>However, keep in mind that the price tag for this kind of footwear is expensive, and can be thousands of dollars for a single pair!</p><p>For those on a budget, or simply don’t want to dish out a couple grand just for some wedding boots, <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=justin+cowboy+boots&amp;linkCode=gs3&amp;linkId=817631ea4271a54c9f91f7d5e88d4f12&amp;tag=asset1048ca00-20">Justin</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/s?k=Corral+cowboy+boots&amp;linkCode=gs3&amp;linkId=c5f27c15c9ddca31c9cc03855a4fa856&amp;tag=asset1048ca00-20">Corral</a> are decent brands to consider as well.</p><p>Both these companies offer boots that are tough, stylish, and affordable.</p><p>If you’re still unsure, pick multiple pairs that you think would go great with your wedding attire, and ask some of your close family members and friends for their opinions.</p><p>It helps to not only feel great in your cowboy boots, but also be <em>seen</em> in them as well.</p><h2><strong>Will a short wedding dress look good with cowboy boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>Yes, yes it would.</strong></p><p>A short wedding dress will not only show off your boots more, but it’s highly recommended that you do so for this purpose. What’s the point of wearing cowboy boots in the first place if your dress is too long for others to see?</p><p>To get more specific, the type of short dress you’ll choose can matter.</p><p>The appropriate length should be about mid-calf hemline or knee-length.</p><p>For overall style, consider picking a lace or western-style dress that will compliment your chosen pair of cowboy boots. If the combination looks great, feels great, and elicits compliments from your friends and family, then you’ve found the right look!</p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>It’s <em>your</em> special day, the final choice of what you wear is what you want the most.</p><p>Aside from the choices already mentioned, you can also check out this <a href="https://bridalmusings.com/175679/boot-barn-cowboy-boots-for-your-wedding/">website</a>, or even this <a href="https://www.bootbarn.com/womens/featured/wedding-collection/?utm_source=PR&amp;utm_medium=PR_Placement&amp;utm_campaign=BridalCampaign_BridalMusings_JUNE">one</a> for more options on how to make your western wedding dreams come true.
