However, the more you search online and in local stores, you find that there’s so much to choose from! After many hard hours of researching, you narrow your choices down to two kinds of material: suede and leather. Yet, now the question remains, which do you choose? Fear not, because in this article, we’ll compare the two materials in detail, and which pair (or pairs) of cowboy boots will work for your lifestyle.</p><hr><h2 class="p1"><strong>Are suede boots more comfortable? Definitely.</strong></h2><p class="p1">First, we need to understand what suede and leather <i>are,</i> respectively. Essentially, the two materials come from the <a href="https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/suede-vs-leather-cowboy-boots/"><span class="s1">same origin</span></a>, meaning suede is the inner layer of the animal skin, while leather composes the outer. However, despite them being made from the same cloth (quite literally), there are still some stark differences between the two. A major one is comfort.</p><p class="p1">Suede itself tends to be very smooth to the touch, up to the point of being called “buttery” in appearance. This material is well-known for being highly skin friendly. Its silky smooth surface will satisfy just about any person who needs something non-abrasive for their footwear needs. If you want to avoid breaking into your new pair of boots, go with suede over leather.</p><p class="p1">Leather is typically tougher and harder to get used to at first. As it’s made from the outer part of the animal skin, it features a hardy nature that repels the elements such as rain and cold. If you spend a lot of time outdoors and need a tough pair of boots to do your activities (hiking, working outdoors, ranching, etc.), pick up a pair of tough leather cowboy boots over suede. They might be a bit less comfortable, but at least your feet will be better protected.</p><hr><h2 class="p1"><strong>Are suede boots dressier than leather? It depends what your definition of “dressy” is.</strong></h2><p class="p1">Suede, in this case, has a “furry” surface that prevents certain kinds of decoration or embroidery from sticking to it. If you want your cowboy boots to have elaborate designs that you can show off to the world, stick with the leather variety.</p><p class="p1">However, suede can still have decorations imprinted on it, but it would have to be through burning methods or lasers. This makes your choices of color and decoration much more limited, as opposed to leather.</p><p class="p1">If your definition of dressy lies with a more comfortable or even “buttery” look, then stick with suede. This appearance has been known to work well with indoor gatherings.</p><hr><h2 class="p1"><strong>How do you protect suede cowboy boots?</strong> <strong>You’ll need a specific coating.</strong></h2><p class="p1">Before getting into the meat and potatoes of the subject, keep in mind that you’ll need to give your suede cowboy boots a <a href="https://www.ariat.com/al/how-to-clean-suede-boots"><span class="s1">thorough cleaning</span></a> first. For all minor blemishes, apply some water and a soft brush (toothbrush, for example). For anything tougher than that, use either white vinegar or a pencil eraser.</p><p class="p1">For further protection, you’ll need to apply a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI0YBGgSFR8"><span class="s1">suede protector</span></a>. These can be picked up at your local department stores such as Walmart. Simply follow the directions on the can to give your suede boots the protection they need.</p><hr><h2 class="p1"><strong>Which is better, suede or leather? It vastly depends what you need them for.</strong></h2><p class="p1">There is no one answer to this question. Which cowboy boot material is better all depends on <i>why</i> you want to wear them. Want to show off your hot new boots at a country music concert? Go with leather cowboy boots. Anything involving walking around in wet, harsh environments requires tough materials. That, or if your job needs you to be outdoors a lot. Leather is also quite <a href="https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/suede-vs-leather-cowboy-boots/"><span class="s1">waterproof</span></a>.</p><p class="p1">Need something more casual and comfortable? Pick suede instead. Boots made with suede leather are also more <a href="https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/suede-vs-leather-cowboy-boots/"><span class="s1">breathable</span></a>, meaning your feet won’t get too sweaty over time. This is especially nice to have for hot weather.</p><hr><h2 class="p1"><strong>Which material is better for over-the-knee cowboy boots? Again, the answer lies in what your footwear needs are.</strong></h2><p class="p1">Over-the-knee cowboy boots don’t differ much from their shorter cousins, aside from the fact that their shafts extend above the knee. Which material you pick is dependent on where you’ll go, and what you’ll walk on (or in).</p><p class="p1">There are some <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/brittany_gibson/best-over-the-knee-boots"><span class="s1">positive</span></a> reviews out there that advocate both leather and suede, but what’s best for <i>you</i> might be different from all those satisfied customers out there. If you don’t mind breaking into your boots and want them to last for <a href="https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/suede-vs-leather-cowboy-boots/"><span class="s1">years on end</span></a>, choose leather above all. If you don’t like the idea of your boots chaffing your skin every time you go for a long walk, pick suede.</p><hr><h2 class="p1"><strong>Which is better for winter, suede or leather? Leather.</strong></h2><p class="p1">Despite them lacking in the comfort department, leather cowboy boots will <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/celiashatzman/2015/01/28/6-ways-to-avoid-ruining-your-boots-this-winter/?sh=3157631388f7"><span class="s1">protect</span></a> you from snow and ice. Leather will insulate your feet better from wet and cold than suede ever can.</p><p class="p1">Due to its breathability, suede will instead absorb moisture so much that you run the risk of getting wet feet. Even though wearing a pair of suede cowboy boots is comfortable, they won’t fare so well during the winter season.</p><hr><h2 class="p1"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p class="p1">All in all, which material works best for you depends on multiple factors, perhaps even some ones that weren’t covered in this article! Other things like arch support, toe-width, ankle support, and even skin conditions might also need to be considered.</p></div><aside class="post__sidebar post__sidebar--left"><div class="sidebar sidebar--sticky"><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Share on:</h3><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fsuede-vs-leather-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fsuede-vs-leather-cowboy-boots%2F&amp;via=Texas%20Walkabout&amp;text=Suede%20vs%20leather%20cowboy%20boots%20(Explained)" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fsuede-vs-leather-cowboy-boots%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=Suede%20vs%20leather%20cowboy%20boots%20(Explained)" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pinterest </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fsuede-vs-leather-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mix </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fsuede-vs-leather-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Suede%20vs%20leather%20cowboy%20boots%20(Explained)&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fsuede-vs-leather-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share buffer" title="Share with Buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Buffer </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Suede%20vs%20leather%20cowboy%20boots%20(Explained) https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fsuede-vs-leather-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp</a></div></section><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Tagged in:</h3><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/" title="Cowboy Boots">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/" title="Western Wear">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div></section><nav class="sidebar__item post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Previous post:</h3><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/wearing-cowboy-boots-to-school/" rel="next">Wearing cowboy boots to school (Should you do it?)</a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Next post:</h3><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/why-do-surgeons-wear-cowboy-boots/" rel="next">Why do surgeons wear cowboy boots?
