However, how the heck do you tell which pair is the right size? Can they be worn with jeans? In this article, we’ll answer those questions and more.</p><hr><h2><strong>What's the ideal leg opening size for cowboy boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>About 20 and ¼ inches.</strong></p><p>Even if you have the right leg opening, keep in mind that there are <a href="https://horseracingsense.com/wearing-mens-cowboy-boots-with-jeans/">certain</a> ways you should consider when wearing jeans with cowboy boots. One thing you should avoid doing most of the time is tucking jeans into your boots, unless you’re working on the ranch or riding a horse and don’t want your pants to get too dirty.</p><p>A highly recommended approach is to wear jeans over the boots, so that most of the shafts are covered. Some brands that work best for this are Ariat and Wranglers.</p><p>Keep in mind the length of your jeans as well. You don’t want them too short or too long. If the pant legs are longer than you’d expect, then you run the risk of stepping on them with your boots. If too short, it will just look weird.</p><hr><h2><strong>How do you measure cowboy boot size?</strong></h2><p><strong>Measure your feet in the store, or draw the length of each foot.</strong></p><p>The easiest way would be to use a Brannock device, a tool that most footwear retailers use to determine a customer’s foot size. However, if you want to measure before heading out to the nearest boot store, consult this <a href="https://stageswest.com/blog/cowboy-boot-sizing-guide/">sizing guide</a> to figure out which size works best for you.</p><p>If you find out that you’re between sizes, it’s a good idea to go with the larger one when selecting a new pair of cowboy boots. Having a bit of extra room is always a nice thing to have, because you never know how much your feet can grow!</p><p>Another thing, measure your feet at least once per year. Even if you have another pair of boots that you can get your size from, your feet won’t remain the same size for long, so measure them just in case.</p><p>One other tip is to wear socks for measurements. Doing so can add ½ a size to your feet, and will get you closer to getting the right pair of boots.</p><hr><h2><strong>How much room should you have in cowboy boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>Experts recommend leaving about 1/8<sup>th</sup> of an inch for the heel lift.</strong></p><p>To be more specific, “heel lift” is the <a href="https://www.ariat.com/al/how-to-fit-cowboy-boots">gap</a> between your heel and the insole of the boot you’re interested in. To achieve this, put a boot on, and then lift your heel up before measuring the gap with your fingers.</p><p>Another thing to be aware of when sizing boots is to check for any extra room in the toe box. With the boot on, use a sideways thumb to see if it fits between the boot tip and your toes.</p><p>Also, make sure the ball of your foot, the widest part of it, aligns with the boot’s outsole. The boots should feel snug, and not too tight.</p><hr><h2><strong>Can you wear straight-leg jeans with cowboy boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>Yep!</strong></p><p>You can also wear <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-wear-boots-with-jeans#4-types-of-jeans-to-wear-with-boots">other</a> kinds of jeans with cowboy boots too! However, guys may want to avoid wearing skinny jeans with their boots, as this fashion choice is more acceptable for gals.</p><p>When it comes to style, don’t forget about choosing a nice color either. Usually darker colors pair well with cowboy boots.</p><hr><h2><strong>How should cowboy boots fit around my leg?</strong></h2><p><strong>Make sure your calves are comfortable.</strong></p><p>When considering the right size, it’s important to find out how a boot feels around your <a href="https://www.deephollowranch.com/how-should-cowboy-boot-fit/">calf</a>. This should be immediately apparent once you slip the boot on. If you encounter too much resistance, that boot is too small for you.</p><p>Don’t forget about your feet! If you put on an ideal pair of cowboy boots and are still unsure, walk around in them to see how they feel. Test out how the balls of your feet bend, and if your toes have a bit of extra space to move around in.</p><p>Remember, you’ll have to break into most pairs of cowboy boots, and you need comfort (the right size!) to do so. Take your time and try things out.</p><p>If it feels like your ankles are flying around inside, then that boot is too large. As cowboy boots don’t use laces, it’s all the more important that you can easily slip into them, and keep them on while you walk around.</p><hr><h2><strong>How are cowboy boots supposed to fit around the shin?</strong></h2><p><strong>Again, find out how your calves feel in boots.</strong></p><p>Your shins aren’t the ideal thing to focus on when sizing. It’s easier to gauge how boots fit around your legs by testing how much room your calves have.</p><p>Try to leave a half-inch up to <a href="https://bootspy.com/how-should-cowboy-boots-fit/">two inches</a> of space between your calves and the boot shafts. As long as your ankles don’t feel too loose when wearing cowboy boots, then a bit of extra space around the legs should be fine.</p><hr><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>When getting <em>any</em> new footwear, it’s important to know what size fits you best. Doing so will allow a much more comfortable experience, especially with leather cowboy boots.</p><p>This is also important when matching them with a pair of jeans. Take your time to pick a pair that compliments the boots, and feels comfortable to wear.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
