Someone tells you that Vaseline can do the trick…but is that stuff good for boots in general? In this article, <a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/do-you-tuck-your-pants-in-cowboy-boots/">we’ll take a look at this product</a> and what it can do for that favorite pair of leather cowboy boots of yours.</p><h2><strong>Can I use Vaseline on my boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>Yes you can.</strong></p><p>Using a little bit of Vaseline can go a long way. Also known as “petroleum jelly,” Vaseline provides many benefits for just about all leather products.</p><p>Seeing how leather is a treated animal skin, Vaseline will react to it similarly to human skin. Some of these benefits include: removing scuffs and scratches, preventing cracking, and providing a bit of cleaning.</p><h2><strong>How do you treat leather cowboy boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>Use diligent care.</strong></p><p><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/do-pants-go-over-or-under-cowboy-boots/">The process can differ </a>whether you’re treating newer vs. older leather boots of any kind. Cowboy boots are no exception.</p><p>As with any leather, your boots will require cleaning after a while.</p><p>A simple way to do this is using a nylon brush and a water-based cleaning agent on the <em>outside </em>of your boot. The inside might require a <a href="https://www.constructiongear.com/caring-for-your-work-boots.html">low PH</a> shampoo and careful rinsing.</p><p>Should your boots be older, you might have to do a lot more scrubbing depending on the buildup of whatever you gathered on them over the years.</p><p>Plus, it’s likely that you also added oil-based protection during that time, which will have to be scrubbed off too.</p><p>For newer boots, you might want to consider adding a leather-conditioner to prevent future wear and tear. Specific areas that need this are any part that will experience a lot of flexing while you wear your boots.</p><p>For either, it’s recommended that you add a water-based agent to water-proof your footwear. We will discuss that in more detail a bit later.</p><h2><strong>Will Vaseline ruin leather?</strong></h2><p><strong>It can if you use it too often.</strong></p><p><a href="https://favoredleather.com/is-petroleum-jelly-good-for-leather/">One source</a> cites “Petroleum Jelly may breakdown the tensile strength of the leather.” Simply put, Vaseline makes the cells within the leather itself swell and expand, causing deformities in your boots.</p><p>Seeing as you have to constantly apply it to keep the benefits of using Vaseline in the first place, it’s risky to use this product more than three times a year. In some cases, some boots have been known to “rot” on occasion.</p><h2><strong>Can you use Vaseline to waterproof leather boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>You can, but only temporarily.</strong></p><p>If the need to waterproof is urgent, Vaseline will help you right away. </p><p>To keep your skin moisturized, it “forms a barrier and prevents water from leaving your skin,” meaning it will have the same effect with leather.</p><p>That barrier will also prevent outside water from getting <em>in</em>.</p><p>However, this should only be for short-term use. There are better products out there that can water-proof those slick boots without the need for a quick-fix.</p><h2><strong>What is the best thing to put on leather boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>Don’t worry, you have options.</strong></p><p>As mentioned earlier, if you need a quick-fix regardless, go with Vaseline. If you apply it enough <a href="https://workgearz.com/can-vaseline-be-used-to-protect-leather-work-boots/">correctly</a>, it will help.</p><p>For the longer term, you can use a variety of products that include water-based agents that have <a href="https://www.constructiongear.com/caring-for-your-work-boots.html">no petroleum</a>, such as various <a href="https://campingsecrets.co.uk/best-product-for-waterproofing-leather-boots/">waxes and sprays</a>. Also, don’t forget that leather conditioners can help too.</p><p>The best you can do for your cowboy boots is keep track of them. Boots are not all that different from anything else people wear on their feet. What your own footwear will go through depends on what you use it for. Are you a rancher? Might want to clean those once every <a href="https://www.shoepassion.com/shoe-encyclopedia/shoe-care/how-to-clean-your-shoes/">two to three weeks</a>. If you’re using boots as formal wear, maybe not as often.</p><p>Also, take a look at your own habits.</p><p>Do you dance with them? Do you use them in the mud? Or are they only for indoors? Where you wear them matters too. You don’t have to treat your cowboys like a beloved pet, but give them a good look once in a while. They at least need attention.</p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>To recap, keep in mind that Vaseline can water-proof, preserve, and even clean them a bit if you apply it right.</p><p>If you need them to last a while, your best bet will be to apply better long-term products.</p><p>Regardless of which combination of the above you choose to go, at the very least be consistent in whatever you do. Keep in mind that your cowboy boots are basically pieces of clothing that need cleaning and care.</p><p><em>Some</em> Vaseline may be okay, other times, not so much. If your boots are already deformed, maybe avoid using that stuff.</p><p>For cleaning, don’t leave them dirty for too long. Got mounds of muck and dirt? Scrub your boots like you mean it. Not a speck of dust?</p><p>Apply a long-term water-based agent. These are only just a few examples. Ultimately, you’ll need to spend time and effort finding the right practice.</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
