Most leather cowboy boots are water-resistant but not waterproof. If you intend to do this, you must first treat the boots with a special product designed to protect leather. If you do not, the snow and freezing rain could do permanent damage to them.</strong></p><p>If you have cowboy boots in a material other than leather, for example, suede, you must ascertain what kind of protection they need from winter snow and moisture. Suede is an even more delicate material than leather and would not stand up well to the wet atmosphere conditions of winter.</p><p>You are best off not wearing either suede or leather boots during the winter or rainy weather at any other time of year. There are many other types of footwear you can put on instead. If you ignore this advice, be prepared to need new cowboy boots every couple of years at least.</p><p> </p><h2>Should you wear cowboy boots during the winter?</h2><p><strong>Yes, as long as you protect them as we discussed. There are many advantages to wearing cowboy boots during the winter. For that matter, this can apply to spring and fall as well. Cowboy boots are typically tall, ranging from about 14 inches to 16 inches in height.</strong></p><p>Additionally, the leather composition is another advantage. Both the composition and the height of cowboy boots make the wearer feel very warm and toasty. This can come in handy during the chilly seasons and even the frigid winter season.</p><p>Please note, although the wearer might be a little hot with cowboy boots on during the summer months, they will protect his or her feet from the scorching summer sun. This is especially useful for people that work or spend leisure time outdoors.</p><p> </p><h2>How do you snow or waterproof cowboy boots?</h2><p><strong>Keep in mind you cannot make leather cowboy boots totally waterproof. That is not the nature of leather. However, you can make them resistant to water, ice, and snow. For this we have some recommendations.</strong></p><p>First, when your boots get soaking wet, no matter what season or what caused the deluge of water onto the boots, let them dry naturally. Do not put them in direct sunlight or a similar heat source such as a portable heater.</p><p>Your best bet is to always protect them from the water in the first place. For that, generously apply some mink oil from a dry, clean, soft cloth. Slather the mink oil directly onto the leather sole and heel of your cowboy boots. You can apply the oil to the rest of the boot as well to make the entire item water-resistant. Do this at least once per month for the best results.</p><p> </p><h2>Can I wear my Ariat boots in the snow?</h2><p><strong>We have been discussing the practicality of wearing cowboy boots in the snow. We talked about how if you are going to wear them, you must protect them first. There is an exception to this rule. That exception is Ariat Hybrid Rancher Waterproof Western Boot. These boots are specifically made for winter's harsh weather.</strong></p><p>The Ariat boots are waterproof and insulated. They are most often seen on cowboys or cowgirls riding on horses. However, these boots can be worn by men or women who want to look stylish and still be protected from wet conditions. They are a practical solution for the problem of wearing cowboy boots in wet weather.</p><p> </p><h2>What are the best cowboy boots for snow and wet weather?</h2><p><strong>As we have just mentioned, Ariat leads the pack. That said, there are a few other types that fit the bill well. These are all great in wet, cold weather for work, recreation, or play. We shall talk about these types now.</strong></p><p> </p><ul><li>Rocky Men's Insulated Pull-On Wellington Boots</li><li>Dan Post Boots Men's Albuquerque</li><li>Ariat Work Men's Workhog Composite Toe Boot</li><li>Women - Ariat Terrain Pull-On Waterproof Boots</li><li>Durango Women's Waterproof Composite Toe Western Boot</li><li>Ariat Hybrid Rancher Waterproof Cowgirl Boot</li><li>Twisted X Women's Cowboy Work Boots</li></ul><p> </p><h2>Are cowboy boots typically warm?</h2><p><strong>In a nutshell, yes they are extremely warm. Due to their sturdy composition of high-grade leather, plus the inner lining, the height of the boots, and the thickness of the soles, they simply ooze warmth. This makes them very sought after in cold weather climates and months.</strong></p><p>Like we talked about earlier, cowboy boots might be a little too warm in summer months. However, they will still protect your feet and lower legs from the intense heat of the season. Not to mention, they will also offer solid protection from the hard atmospheric conditions of working on the range or a ranch. Therefore, you can still wear them in hot weather.</p><p> </p><h2>Waterproof Insulated Cowboy Boots</h2><p><strong>You may be wondering if the cost and effort of waterproofing cowboy boots is worth it. The answer is definitely yes. Think of how much you spent on the boots to begin with. Then think about all the wet weather you have wherever you live.</strong></p><p>Even if it doesn't literally snow much, it probably rains a lot. Rain is just as harmful to your boots as snow. Now think about the cost of repeatedly repairing your boots. Or how about having to buy a new pair every couple of years. Now ask yourself if waterproofing them is worth the money and time. We think you see our point!</p><p> </p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p><strong>The whole point of this article is that, yes you can wear cowboy boots in the winter if you take proper precautions. If you have plenty of money to spend on new boots every couple of years, then you can ignore our advice. It is totally up to you!</strong></p></div><aside class="post__sidebar post__sidebar--left"><div class="sidebar sidebar--sticky"><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Share on:</h3><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fcowboy-boots-for-winter%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fcowboy-boots-for-winter%2F&amp;via=Texas%20Walkabout&amp;text=8%20Things%20To%20Know%20About%20Wearing%20Cowboy%20Boots%20During%20Winter" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fcowboy-boots-for-winter%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=8%20Things%20To%20Know%20About%20Wearing%20Cowboy%20Boots%20During%20Winter" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pinterest </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fcowboy-boots-for-winter%2F" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mix </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fcowboy-boots-for-winter%2F" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=8%20Things%20To%20Know%20About%20Wearing%20Cowboy%20Boots%20During%20Winter&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fcowboy-boots-for-winter%2F" class="js-share buffer" title="Share with Buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Buffer </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=8%20Things%20To%20Know%20About%20Wearing%20Cowboy%20Boots%20During%20Winter https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fcowboy-boots-for-winter%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp</a></div></section><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Tagged in:</h3><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/" title="Cowboy Boots">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/" title="Western Wear">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div></section><nav class="sidebar__item post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Previous post:</h3><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/cowboy-boots-with-turned-up-toes/" rel="next">5 things to know about Cowboy boots with turned up toes</a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Next post:</h3><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/cowboy-boots-for-truck-drivers/" rel="next">5 Things To Know About Cowboy Boots For Truck Drivers</a></div></nav></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__author"><div><h3 class="h6"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/authors/texas-walkabout/" rel="author">Texas Walkabout</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><div class="post__related"><h3>Related post</h3><div class="l-grid"><article class="c-card c-card--compact"><div class="c-card__body"><header><h2 class="c-card__title c-card__title--compact"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/sports-coat-with-jeans-and-cowboy-boots/">7 Tips For Wearing A Sports Coat With Jeans And Cowboy Boots </a></h2></header><div class="metadata c-card__metadata c-card__metadata--compact"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/" class="metadata__maintag">Cowboy Boots</a> <a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/authors/texas-walkabout/" class="metadata__author">Texas Walkabout</a> <time datetime="2022-03-06T11:20" class="metadata__date">03.06.2022</time></div></div></article><article class="c-card c-card--compact"><div class="c-card__body"><header><h2 class="c-card__title c-card__title--compact"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/do-pants-go-over-or-under-cowboy-boots/">Do pants go over or under cowboy boots?
