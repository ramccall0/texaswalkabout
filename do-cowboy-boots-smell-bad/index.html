Another one is foot odor.</strong></p><p><strong>This happens after you have been wearing your boots for a while and your feet were hot and sweaty.</strong></p><p><strong>The last one is a musty smell.</strong></p><p><strong>A combination of factors can contribute to that smell. Want to know more? Keep reading this article.</strong></p><hr><h2>Do cowboy boots make your feet stink?</h2><p><strong>It is more like the other way around. Smelly, sweaty feet will make your cowboy boots stink.</strong></p><p>No matter how comfortable your boots are, long periods of wear will make your feet hot and sweaty. This is especially true if you do not wear socks with them.</p><p>After a while the odor accumulates inside your boots and presto, you have stinky cowboy boots.</p><hr><h2>How can you make your cowboy boots not smell?</h2><p><strong>Making sure your feet do not smell when you wear the boots can mitigate the smell coming from them.</strong></p><p><strong>You can also use products made to make your feet not smell such as odor eaters.</strong></p><p>Once the smell does permeate your boots, you can sprinkle some baking soda on the insides. Then let the boots sit overnight. Better yet, put your boots outside in the fresh air overnight.</p><p>The combination of the fresh air and the baking soda should eliminate the horrible odor from the boots.</p><hr><h2>Ways to prevent your cowboy boots from smelling</h2><p><strong>Keeping in mind it is not possible to completely prevent your boots from smelling, we will list some factors that should at least lessen the odor emanating from them.</strong></p><p><strong>They are as follows:</strong></p><p> </p><ul><li>Spend a little money on them when you buy them, do not go with the cheapest boots</li><li>Keep your feet, legs, and body clean</li><li>Make sure you are always wearing clean socks</li><li>Avoid cotton socks altogether</li><li>Do not wear the same pair of boots all the time</li><li>Keep your boots in a well-ventilated place</li><li>Be proactive with the baking soda, sprinkle it inside the boots BEFORE they start to smell</li><li>Leave them outside in the fresh air periodically</li><li>Try to avoid letting your boots get soaking wet too often</li></ul><hr><h2>Other options for getting rid of the odor from your cowboy boots</h2><p><strong>Take a little bit of white vinegar and mix it with water inside a spray bottle. The vinegar not only will neutralize the smell, but will kill any bacteria as well.</strong></p><p><strong>Take this mixture and spray the inside of your boots after each use.</strong></p><p><strong>Then allow them to dry for a period of time.</strong></p><p>If you do not like this idea, you can stick to the baking soda method.</p><p>But know that this mixture of vinegar and water will work just as well.</p><p>As we just said, there is good old-fashioned plain fresh air. Leaving your boots outside for a while will also work wonders. Any of these methods should do the trick.</p><hr><h2>What factors can contribute to smelly cowboy boots?</h2><p><strong>We have been discussing that.</strong></p><p><strong>In the first place, repeated use of the boots will see a build-up of sweat from your feet.</strong></p><p><strong>If you like to wear the same socks more than one day, the smell inside your socks will also accumulate. Ultimately that will make your boots smell.</strong></p><p>On the other hand, you did not buy your cowboy boots to have them sit in your closet forever.</p><p>You bought them to wear.</p><p>No matter how many pairs you have, or what precautions you take, eventually your boots will start to smell. Following our advice will help you out.</p><hr><h2>Is it okay to wear cowboy boots without socks?</h2><p><strong>Sure, if that is what you want to do, be our guest. Just remember that there won't be any barrier between your hot, sweaty feet and your boots. Socks are that barrier.</strong></p><p><strong>If you choose not to wear them, expect your cowboy boots to start smelling pretty quickly.</strong></p><p>Wearing boots without socks can also be rather uncomfortable.</p><p>Think about it!</p><p>Your bare feet rubbing against the often hard interior lining of your shoes or boots! How uncomfortable will that be?</p><p>You can choose not to wear the socks, but be ready for the consequences.</p><hr><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p><strong>Of course the idea of stinky cowboy boots is an unpleasant one. But there are solutions for this.</strong></p><p><strong>Foot odor should not come between you and your boots. You bought the boots because you loved them and want to wear them.</strong></p><p><strong>Go right ahead and do that.</strong></p><p><strong>Foot odor is not the end of the world. Men, women, children - enjoy wearing your western boots!</strong></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
