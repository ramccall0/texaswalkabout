Does this sound a bit confusing? Then keep reading this article. We will explain this topic in detail and clarify the mystery behind it.</strong></p><p> </p><h2>Can men wear their pants tucked into their cowboy boots?</h2><p><strong>The fashion experts say no, they cannot. Men typically wear wide-legged pants such as jeans or slacks. Those would look rather silly tucked into cowboy boots.</strong></p><p>Then there is the practicality aspect of it. Most jobs require men to be on the go a lot. When their pants are crammed into their cowboy boots it makes it difficult to move around. So, they are best off not doing it.</p><p>One last point is that constantly jamming the pants inside the boots can ruin them. Slacks, suit pants, or even jeans can become permanently creased or worn around the spot of the calves. You certainly don't want this to happen, right?</p><p> </p><h2>Can women do it?</h2><p><strong>Women have more choices than men when it comes to tucking their pants into their boots. Many women wear leggings, tight-fitting jeans, or spandex-style pants which hug the lower legs. Pants such as these are meant to be tucked into a sweet pair of cowboy boots.</strong></p><p>There are times when the same woman will wear pants that are loose at the bottom. Examples of these would be bell-bottoms, loose-fitting jeans, slacks, or pantsuit bottoms. She has a choice of tucking the pants into the boots or letting them hang loose. Either is considered fashionable by style experts.</p><p>With women, the occasion plays a role in the answer. For a more formal occasion, she is better off letting the pants hang down over the boots. If she is riding a horse, a bicycle, a motorcycle, or moving around a lot, it is prudent to tuck the pants smoothly down into the boots.</p><p> </p><h2>Can kids wear their pants over their cowboy boots?</h2><p><strong>When they are involved in an activity, we would say no, do not. They are always running around or participating in some kind of sport. When doing so, the kids are more apt to trip over them and get hurt. During this time, it is best to tuck the pants into their cowboy boots.</strong></p><p>On the other hand, if you want them to look proper for school, religious services, or a visit with the grandparents, they can wear their pants over the boots. Especially if they are a dressier type of pants. Like women, kids have many options; sometimes with the assistance of their parents.</p><p>One great thing about being a kid wearing cowboy boots is they can get away with things that adults cannot. One of those things is the concept of wearing pants over their pants. Who knows? The child could be much more comfortable that way.</p><p> </p><h2>When do you put cowboy boots under your pants?</h2><p><strong>Traditionally, it is anytime you are attending a formal occasion. It could be a business meeting, a fancy dinner party, perhaps even a wedding. At such events it is frowned upon to wear your pants inside your cowboy boots.</strong></p><p>As we discussed earlier, another time to do so is when you are working at a particularly active job. It is highly uncomfortable to have your pants bunched up inside the cowboy boots when moving around. Who wants to walk around like that anyhow?</p><p>Although you want room between the boots and your legs, you really don't want them to appear baggy. Pants look best when they are form-fitted and not sticking up out of your cowboy boots.</p><h2> </h2><h2>Should you be putting cowboy boots underneath jeans?</h2><p><strong>What many people do is buy their jeans specifically to wear with their cowboy boots. That way, they can make certain the jeans are form-fitting on the top part of the legs but wide enough on the bottom to properly fit over the boots.</strong></p><p>When shopping for jeans, we recommend bringing the boots you want to wear with them. Then try on various pairs of jeans to ensure you get the perfect fit. You want to look like your cowboy boots were made just for those jeans. This applies to men and women. My, how fabulous you will look!</p><p> </p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p><strong>In the end, it is really up to the individual whether to wear their pants over or tucked into their cowboy boots. Nobody is going to put you in jail over an unpopular decision. You must do what is comfortable for yourself. Perhaps you disregard those folks who disagree with you. You know the old saying; if it feels good, do it!</strong></p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
