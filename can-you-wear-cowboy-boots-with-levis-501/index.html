Wearing the right cowboy boots and jeans are no exception. You’ve heard of the classic Levis 501 jeans, but are they a good match for western-style footwear? In this article, we’ll discuss the answer to that question and more!</p><hr><h2><strong>Can you wear cowboy boots with Levis 501 jeans?</strong></h2><p><strong>That’s a resounding yes!</strong></p><p>Made of 100% cotton, Levis 501 jeans are a <a href="https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/best-levis-for-cowboy-boots/">good match</a> for cowboy boots. Sporting extra thigh room, you won’t have many problems fitting this brand of jeans over your footwear.</p><p>There’s even a “sit-at-waist type” you can get if your job requires constant lifting of heavy loads. Even if you’re standing up and sitting down all day long, your 501 Levis won’t let you down.</p><p>One disadvantage, however, that these particular jeans have is the need to break into them. A fresh pair of Levis 501 will feel very stiff at first, but will adjust to your body shape the more you wear them.</p><hr><h2><strong>Should you wear cowboy boots with Levis 501 jeans?</strong></h2><p><strong>That’s entirely up to you.</strong></p><p>First off, keep in mind that there’s a <a href="https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/best-levis-for-cowboy-boots/">huge selection</a> of jeans you can pair your cowboy boots with. It’s not a matter of one-size-fits-all. A good idea would be to find some jeans that feel comfortable to wear. Don’t pick something out for style alone. Remember, <em>you’re</em> the one who’s going to be wearing them!</p><p>In his review, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHk26s3oz90">Jeremiah Craig</a> tries out a fresh pair of Levis 501 with multiple types of boots. These jeans will work very well with just about any cowboy boot, but he warns viewers to beware wearing Levis 501 with ropers and a wide square toe. This is because of how these cowboy boots have very wide tops, and may not fit right underneath the jeans.</p><p>Another piece of advice he leaves viewers with is that Levis 501 might not work if you’re too skinny. As the leggings flare out a bit, a skinny person might find themselves wearing an un-pleasant baggy look.</p><p>Just to be safe, if you’re going with the 501 model, stick with cowboy boots that have narrower tops to avoid a weird look. You want to look good, not have your jeans stretch out too much, especially around the legs.</p><hr><h2><strong>What jeans work with cowboy boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>Wide/Relaxed Fit, Regular/Straight Leg, and Boot-Cut.</strong></p><p>What we’re focused on here is not brand name, but jean type. You’ll want a pair that <a href="https://www.ariat.com/al/how-to-wear-cowboy-boots-and-jeans-men">fits around your boots</a>. Jeans such as the boot-cut variety flare around the legs, allowing more space to tuck cowboy boots into.</p><p>Levis 501 can work as well, as long as the tops of your boots aren’t too wide. If you’re not going to buy a slimmer pair of cowboy boots in the near future, then try out either boot-cut or wide/relaxed fit jeans. What works well will check your boxes for both style <em>and</em> comfort.</p><hr><h2><strong>Do cowboys still wear Levis?</strong></h2><p><strong>They sure do!</strong></p><p>The real deal, does in fact, still wear Levis jeans. They’re especially useful when materials such as <a href="https://horseracingsense.com/what-kind-of-jeans-cowboys-wear/">lycra and elastane</a> are added to their cotton construction. This allows more flexibility, especially for rough horse rides or rugged ranch work.</p><p>However, even though Levis jeans are worn by actual cowboys, many prefer <a href="https://horseracingsense.com/what-kind-of-jeans-cowboys-wear/">Wranglers</a> over anything else. They simply find them tougher for the jobs they need to do. Even if they can be incredibly stiff to wear, Wranglers are known to protect modern cowboys from cold winter temperatures.</p><hr><h2><strong>Are Levi’s 501 still fashionable?</strong></h2><p><strong>They are, but you might want to stick with a classic look for the best results.</strong></p><p>Ever since their inception in <a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/levis-jeans-review/">1873</a>, Levis 501 jeans have been used by miners and cowboys alike. Even today, these types of jeans are used for rough work just about everywhere.</p><p>You can still achieve a nice stylish look with them, but you’ll need to pair these jeans with “classic” pieces of clothing that go with them. Levis has kept their 501 model mostly the same for over a century, and doesn’t plan to change that anytime soon.</p><p>With that being said, it would be harder to achieve a more “modern” look with a pair of Levis 501. They’re not made for fancy dress and the latest fashions, so stick with more classic styles of attire.</p><p>To help you achieve this, find some 501 jeans that come in medium-blue or <a href="https://horseracingsense.com/what-kind-of-jeans-cowboys-wear/">charcoal-wash</a>, especially if you’re going for that classy western look. The color could matter more than any other accessories you pick!</p><hr><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>So to recap, a pair of 501 Levis jeans will work <em>great</em> with many types of cowboy boots. They do, however, come with some drawbacks like being stiff to wear, or will not accommodate boots with wider tops.</p><p>Your overall body shape will factor in as well. Being too large and muscular or very skinny means a 501 pair might not be the best. Remember, there are <a href="https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/best-levis-for-cowboy-boots/">many</a> different pairs of jeans you can pick from, so you’re far from being out of options.</p><p>The best way to find out is to try out a pair yourself. You won’t know for certain if these jeans will work or not until you’ve paired them with your cowboy boots inside a store. Now that you have a little more knowledge than before, start exploring!</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
