Originally there were no boots that were comfortable for hiking. They were made with slippery soles and rather pointy toes. People could not wear these boots to work either for the same reasons. Nowadays, there are cowboy boots suitable for hiking and working.</strong></p><p>Fast-forward to our modern era when cowboy boot manufacturers saw a need for models designed to be worn on long hikes or for work. Today such boots are available on the commercial market. There are also such models available for every budget. Be sure to try them on before you buy them to be sure they are comfortable.</p><hr><h2>Who makes cowboy boots suitable for hiking?</h2><p><strong>Most of the major boot manufacturers now include at least one pair. Names like Ariat, Tecovas, and Lucchese amongst many others. To get an idea of them it is possible to search online, for example the source where you found this article.</strong></p><p>What you can do is go into any western boot store and tell the sales associate you want boots that you can hike in as well as look great. He or she ought to be able to help you find the perfect pair. Boots like these should also be good to work in. Keep these needs in mind when you are selecting them. As we said, definitely try them on before buying.</p><hr><h2>Make sure they are durable and strong!</h2><p><strong>The old saying you get what you pay for rings true here. When looking for cowboy boots to hike and/or work in, be sure they are from a reliable source. You do not want a boot that cannot stand up to the punishment they will undergo. You want a sturdy, hearty boot that will last a long time.</strong></p><p>Ask pertinent questions of the sales associate. You want boots that are tough and built for rugged terrain. Additionally, you want them to be water-resistant in the event you wear them in wet weather. Does this kind of cowboy boot actually exist? Yes, it does. You just need to take the time to shop for them.</p><hr><h2>How far can you walk in cowboy boots?</h2><p><strong>If you buy the kind of cowboy boot designed for hiking, you will be able to walk pretty far. </strong>Keep in mind, no matter what type of shoes or boots you wear, after a while your feet will get tired and possibly smelly. That is just the nature of footwear and extended use.</p><p>One important tip is to steer clear of boots with pointy toes and slippery soles. Keep those for your dressier outings. Ideally, it is good to own several pairs of boots. You want some for hiking and working and others to show off how stylish you can be. The sales associate can usually help you select the right pair.</p><p> </p><hr><h2>Are cowboy boots comfortable to walk in?</h2><p><strong>In order to be able to walk comfortably in cowboy boots, you want to look at types such as stockmen, ropers, and western work boots. They feature wider toes and heels designed for balancing on rough terrain as well as sand and slippery surfaces.</strong></p><p>We must note that most of the major brands of cowboy boots have at least one model that fits this description. If you have a favorite brand, ask the salesperson to show you suitable models. They will know precisely which boots will accommodate your needs.</p><hr><h2>What about western boots for women and children?</h2><p><strong>The same availability should apply to boots for women and children. Boot makers that cater to men who want to use them for hiking will most likely have models for them too. They need not give up style in order to get practicality.</strong></p><p>With the ever-increasing popularity of boots amongst the masses of people, the makers have created the perfect boot for every purpose. That trend is certain to continue as folks are snapping up western boots of all kinds.</p><hr><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p><strong>If your preferred boot maker does not have a style that is good for hiking or working, try a different maker. There is no rule that says all your boots must come from the same source. You can own as many pairs of cowboy boots as you want.</strong></p><p>You can also try getting in touch with your preferred maker and suggesting it. Many companies thrive on customer suggestions. Who knows, maybe they will listen to you. Meanwhile, you have plenty of other brands to select from. Enjoy your boots!</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
