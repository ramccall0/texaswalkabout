In the past, perhaps they did not. Nowadays, however, they definitely do. It depends on what kind you buy. In 2022, it is possible to find cowboy boots perfect for the truckers' lifestyle and work needs. Read on to find out more.</strong></p><p> </p><h2>Do truckers really wear cowboy boots?</h2><p><strong>Actually, many of them do. The stereotype is that truckers wear only cowboy boots with jeans. This is a bit of an overreach, not all of them do. However, there are quite a number that do and pretty much all the time. Some people are more comfortable in cowboy boots than any other type of footwear.</strong></p><p>For truckers, cowboy boots are multifunctional. They can be worn all day in the cabin of the big-rig. Then the boots can be worn into town at night into the bars and rest stops. The truck drivers can pick out one pair of boots that will suit every purpose during his road trip. He or she can never go wrong this way.</p><p> </p><h2>Are they comfortable in the cowboy boots?</h2><p><strong>They can be if the person has cowboy boots with a wider foot and toe area. When a trucker is shopping for his or her cowboy boots, the key is to pick out a pair that is comfortable to begin with.</strong></p><p>There are many manufacturers and styles of cowboy boots. It is up to each customer to select boots that are comfortable and still rugged enough to stand up to the many grueling hours on the road. He or she might also want to buy a pair that is waterproof since they are bound to encounter plenty of wet weather along the way.</p><p> </p><h2>Can truckers drive with cowboy boots on?</h2><p><strong>Yes they can, depending on the brand and model of boots they buy. If you go for pure style with the pointy toes and higher heels, it will likely be more difficult to drive. The key is to choose a pair that fits you well, and you know will be comfortable.</strong></p><p>It isn't like you buy cowboy boots totally blind. Most people go into a store and try on different brands and models until they find the perfect pair for themselves. As a truck driver, you know the kind of usage they will undergo, such as the long hours behind the wheel with your feet on the gas and brake pedals. It is up to you to select a pair that you can drive in.</p><h2> </h2><h2>What cowboy boots are best for truck drivers while working?</h2><p><strong>It would be helpful if you knew which brands and models were best suited to truckers in the first place. There are several we can recommend right off the bat. If you do not like these makers, you are free to choose one you do like. Again, the way to go is to try them on before you buy them. Here is our list to get you started.</strong></p><p> </p><ul><li>Ariat - Circuit Patriot Western Boot</li><li>The Cartwright from Tecovas</li><li>Groundbreaker Work Boot from Ariat in a few different models</li><li>Tecovas - The Earl</li><li>Wolverine - Men's Rancher Square Toe Boots</li><li>Irish Setter - Work Men's 83910 Marshall Boots</li><li>Ariat - Sport Patriot Western Boots</li><li>Tony Lama Leather Mid-Calf Western Boots</li><li>Lucchese - several different models available</li><li>Justin Men's Brown Leather Cowboy Boots</li></ul><p> </p><h2>Do cowboy boots have good traction?</h2><p><strong>In the past, the answer would have been no. In those days it was common for cowboy boots to be made with leather soles that were smooth on the bottom. They were rather slippery. Fast-forward to 2022 and boot makers have adjusted for this.</strong></p><p>Although it is still possible to purchase boots with smooth soles, it is also prevalent to find many models that are made with rubber soles. This makes for much better traction. Now truckers can wear stylish-looking cowboy boots that are better suited for working and for maneuvering on wet, slippery surfaces.</p><p> </p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p><strong>For truck drivers who prefer a stylish look to a rugged one, a great pair of cowboy boots is possible to find. You do not have to give up comfort and practicality in order to own and wear them.</strong></p><p>There are so many makers and models of cowboy boots that you are assured of finding multiple pairs that are perfect for your lifestyle. Why stop at one pair? Own several, one pair for each mood or occasion that comes into play. You will look terrific in them all too.</p></div><aside class="post__sidebar post__sidebar--left"><div class="sidebar sidebar--sticky"><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Share on:</h3><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fcowboy-boots-for-truck-drivers%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fcowboy-boots-for-truck-drivers%2F&amp;via=Texas%20Walkabout&amp;text=5%20Things%20To%20Know%20About%20Cowboy%20Boots%20For%20Truck%20Drivers" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fcowboy-boots-for-truck-drivers%2F&amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fmedia%2Fposts%2F21%2Fmegan-bucknall-cAeVLl7NKLs-unsplash.jpg&amp;description=5%20Things%20To%20Know%20About%20Cowboy%20Boots%20For%20Truck%20Drivers" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pinterest </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fcowboy-boots-for-truck-drivers%2F" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mix </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fcowboy-boots-for-truck-drivers%2F" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=5%20Things%20To%20Know%20About%20Cowboy%20Boots%20For%20Truck%20Drivers&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fcowboy-boots-for-truck-drivers%2F" class="js-share buffer" title="Share with Buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Buffer </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=5%20Things%20To%20Know%20About%20Cowboy%20Boots%20For%20Truck%20Drivers https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fcowboy-boots-for-truck-drivers%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp</a></div></section><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Tagged in:</h3><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/" title="Cowboy Boots">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/" title="Western Wear">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div></section><nav class="sidebar__item post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Previous post:</h3><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/cowboy-boots-for-winter/" rel="next">8 Things To Know About Wearing Cowboy Boots During Winter</a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Next post:</h3><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/dress-cowboy-boots-with-suit/" rel="next">7 Tips For Wearing Dress cowboy boots With A Suit</a></div></nav></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__author"><div><h3 class="h6"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/authors/texas-walkabout/" rel="author">Texas Walkabout</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><div class="post__related"><h3>Related post</h3><div class="l-grid"><article class="c-card c-card--compact"><div class="c-card__body"><header><h2 class="c-card__title c-card__title--compact"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/sports-coat-with-jeans-and-cowboy-boots/">7 Tips For Wearing A Sports Coat With Jeans And Cowboy Boots </a></h2></header><div class="metadata c-card__metadata c-card__metadata--compact"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/" class="metadata__maintag">Cowboy Boots</a> <a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/authors/texas-walkabout/" class="metadata__author">Texas Walkabout</a> <time datetime="2022-03-06T11:20" class="metadata__date">03.06.2022</time></div></div></article><article class="c-card c-card--compact"><div class="c-card__body"><header><h2 class="c-card__title c-card__title--compact"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/do-pants-go-over-or-under-cowboy-boots/">Do pants go over or under cowboy boots?
