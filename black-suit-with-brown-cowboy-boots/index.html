We will answer a few other relevant questions as well. Make sure you read it all the way through.</strong></p><h2>Can you wear brown cowboy boots with black suit?</h2><p><strong>The simple answer is yes, you can. However, there are a couple of fashion rules that apply here. They make the difference as to how the brown cowboy boots can be worn with a black suit. So, what are these rules? Let's take a look.</strong></p><p><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/is-vaseline-good-for-cowboy-boots/">First, the shade of brown makes a huge difference. It is important to choose a darker shade.</a> A lighter shade of brown or a tan boot simply will not work. When selecting the rest of the outfit, keep things on a monochromatic level. Not only will this make your overall look better, it will make the darker brown cowboy boots stand out.</p><p>The other rule is, it depends on where you are wearing this combination. Is it a social occasion? A business meeting or a day at the office? An occasion that calls for an elegant appearance? <a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/do-you-tuck-your-pants-in-cowboy-boots/">If the answer to any of these questions is yes, you can wear the brown cowboy boots.</a> However, they should be a dressier style.</p><p>Â </p><h2>Should you wear a black suit with brown cowboy boots?</h2><p><strong>The safer bet is to wear black cowboy boots with the black suit. That is why most men choose this combination. However, when the specific style of cowboy boot fits the occasion, a dark brown color looks quite fine. In fact, it is rather dashing.</strong></p><p>Something that matters here is if the suit is a solid black, or it has pinstripes on it. If it does, you would be best off wearing a black boot. It can be a stylish cowboy boot though. <a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/sports-coat-with-jeans-and-cowboy-boots/">If you want to be daring though, a freshly-shined dark brown boot would look very spiffy with such a suit.</a></p><p>The material of the suit can also be a factor in determining the color and style of shoes or boots to wear. According to the fashion gurus, a black linen suit would look fabulous with brown cowboy boots.</p><h2>When should you consider wearing a black suit with brown cowboy boots?</h2><p><strong>There are many occasions where a black suit with brown cowboy boots are appropriate. Not only for men, but for women wearing a black pants suit for that special occasion. Like when? Keep reading.</strong></p><p>This combination can be worn to political events. Over the years, even presidents have done this. Other times you will see people in mariachi bands wearing them. Law enforcement officers tend to sport this look when attending special events. You might think of rangers in western states like Texas.</p><p><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/">Fashion trends have come a long way in the past few decades. Whereas it used to be a fashion faux pas to wear a combination like that, today it is widely accepted. </a>Go ahead and wear them.</p><h2>What color suit goes with brown cowboy boots?</h2><p><strong>There are more colors than you might think that will look terrific with brown cowboy boots. You can try different shades of blue, darker green colors, beige or tan suits too. How about a nice charcoal gray suit with them? That would look stunning and very manly.</strong></p><p>One tip to remember is, the fancier the suit is, both in color and material, the fancier the boots should be. Imagine your cowboy boots in a dark brown snake skin or alligator hide. <a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/black-suit-with-brown-cowboy-boots/">Don't laugh, we are serious! Not only can you find boots like that, but they'll make you appear sensational.</a></p><p>Another option for the material of your brown cowboy boots is a nice, smooth suede. Oh, how handsome you will be in those. If your suit color is also brown, your boots will enhance your overall appearance.</p><h2>Is it OK to wear boots with a suit?</h2><p><strong>As we discussed earlier, nowadays, that is a more hip fashion trend. Decades ago it would have been frowned upon, but today it is fine. Again, it depends on the occasion.</strong></p><p>What about a woman wearing boots with her pantsuit? We touched on that briefly too. Basically, it is now acceptable if the circumstances are right. It has to be the right event and the pantsuit is not too formal.</p><p>With men or women, they should remember that a snazzy pair of cowboy boots in the right style is just as dressy as a pair of dress shoes. They are probably more comfortable too. So, wear the boots with your suit. You are bound to receive compliments.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p><strong>There is nothing like owning a pair of genuine cowboy boots in brown. For that matter, you can own a couple of them in various materials and styles. Then you will have a pair for any occasion that arises.</strong></p><p><strong>You don't even need to live in the west to own fine cowboy boots. If no store sells it locally, get them over the Internet. Just be sure you know your correct size. Your friends will marvel over how nice they look. Your business clients will be impressed too. So, what is stopping you from buying a pair right now?</strong></p></div><aside class="post__sidebar post__sidebar--left"><div class="sidebar sidebar--sticky"><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Share on:</h3><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fblack-suit-with-brown-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fblack-suit-with-brown-cowboy-boots%2F&amp;via=Texas%20Walkabout&amp;text=Black%20suit%20with%20brown%20cowboy%20boots%20%7C%20CAN%20IT%20BE%20DONE%3F" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fblack-suit-with-brown-cowboy-boots%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=Black%20suit%20with%20brown%20cowboy%20boots%20%7C%20CAN%20IT%20BE%20DONE%3F" class="js-share pinterest" title="Share with Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pinterest </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fblack-suit-with-brown-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share mix" title="Share with Mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mix </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fblack-suit-with-brown-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=Black%20suit%20with%20brown%20cowboy%20boots%20%7C%20CAN%20IT%20BE%20DONE%3F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fblack-suit-with-brown-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share buffer" title="Share with Buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Buffer </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Black%20suit%20with%20brown%20cowboy%20boots%20%7C%20CAN%20IT%20BE%20DONE%3F https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fblack-suit-with-brown-cowboy-boots%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp</a></div></section><section class="sidebar__item"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Tagged in:</h3><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/" title="Cowboy Boots">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/" title="Western Wear">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div></section><nav class="sidebar__item post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><h3 class="sidebar__title">Previous post:</h3><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/is-vaseline-good-for-cowboy-boots/" rel="next">Is vaseline good for cowboy boots?
