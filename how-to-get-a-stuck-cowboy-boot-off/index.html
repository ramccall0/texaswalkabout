This can be one of the most frustrating and uncomfortable things when it comes to putting clothes on.</p><p>The reason is because the leather usually when you first get your pair of boots, is very stiff and is not comfortable at all to put your feet in and out of.<strong> In order to get your a cowboy boots off your foot and leg, you’ll want to grab the heel of the boot and probably slide it down word while arch in your foot upwards or downwards.</strong></p><p>You should noticed that as you do that, <a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/wear-cowboy-boots-with-or-without-socks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the boot will begin to properly slight off and your heel will slide upward allowing you to shuttle your entire foot and leg out of the boot.</a></p><p class="p1">Again, this is not that fun to do, but as you start to wear them a lot more often, then you should notice that the weather actually starts to break in and the boots are not that hard to wear anymore. Let’s take a quick look though, at whether or not they are supposed to be this hard to takeoff.</p><h2 class="p1">Are cowboy boots supposed to be hard to take off?</h2><p class="p1">In general, whenever you purchase a new pair of leather cowboy boots, you should always expect them to be rather stiff and hard to slide on and off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p1"><strong>The leather is basically brand new, and it needs to be weathered down somewhat in order for it to become more malleable. By wearing your boots out and around town, you should notice that eventually, they will become a lot more comfortable to wear in general, and you are able to put them on and off with ease.</strong></p><p class="p1">Just keep on wearing them and eventually he will love to wear cowboy boots everywhere you go. <a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/what-color-cowboy-hat-to-wear-with-brown-boots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Then only that, they can be rather stylish depending on which ones you get. Let’s take a quick look again at how you get these tight little boots off your feet.</a></p><h2>How do you get tight boots off?</h2><p class="p1"><strong>In order to properly get tight boots off, you’ll want to grab the heel, and promptly pull it away from your actual heel in a downward motion.</strong></p><p>As you do this, curl your feet downward, exposing your actual heel in an upward position that is opposite to the direction you are pulling the boot.</p><p><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You will notice that the hill actually starts to slide away from you, allowing you to escape your foot.</a></p><p class="p1">If you don’t want to do this manually yourself, then you can use a little tool that we will talk about in the next section of this article.</p><h2>What do you call the thing that helps you take boots off?</h2><p class="p1"><strong>The thing that helps you take boots off is known as a cowboy boot jack.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></strong></p><p class="p1"><strong>You basically just slide it down the shaft of the boot until it hits the bottom of the boot heel next to your actual heel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></strong></p><p class="p1">This allows you to manually pry open the shaft of the boot to allow your leg and foot to escape the leather. It’s quite effective, it is something you should consider as you start to wear your brand new pair of boots all around town.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p class="p1">It really is not that comfortable the feeling having very tight boots, but just rest assured that as you start to wear them everywhere, you’ll notice that they start to soften up on you.</p><h2>How can I soften my cowboy boots?</h2><p class="p1">If you want to really try and soften up your boots, I recommend only doing so naturally. <strong><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The best way to naturally soften your cowboy boots is to put them on and where them basically wherever you go.</a></strong></p><p>This will allow the leather to begin weathering down, obtaining some moisture, and overtime slowly forming to your profile of your foot and leg. You can manually try to stretch your boots, but that is not recommended since you may be doing more harm than good by overstretching them and possibly tearing the leather.</p><h2 class="p1">Final Thoughts</h2><p class="p1"><strong>Getting cowboy boots off your foot can be an uncomfortable task, especially if they are tight and not that pleasant to wear. In order to properly get them off just grab heel and put away from your actual heel while arching your foot either upwards or downwards to let the boot slowly slide off. You can use a cowboy boot jack in order to expedite this process.</strong></p><p class="p1"> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on February 19, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fhow-to-get-a-stuck-cowboy-boot-off%2F" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://texaswalkabout.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fhow-to-get-a-stuck-cowboy-boot-off%2F&amp;via=Texas%20Walkabout&amp;text=How%20to%20get%20a%20stuck%20cowboy%20boot%20off%3F%20(Explained)" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://texaswalkabout.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fhow-to-get-a-stuck-cowboy-boot-off%2F&amp;media=undefined&amp;description=How%20to%20get%20a%20stuck%20cowboy%20boot%20off%3F%20(Explained)" class="js-share pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://texaswalkabout.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#pinterest"/></svg> <span>Pinterest</span> </a><a href="https://mix.com/add?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fhow-to-get-a-stuck-cowboy-boot-off%2F" class="js-share mix" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://texaswalkabout.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#mix"/></svg> <span>Mix</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fhow-to-get-a-stuck-cowboy-boot-off%2F" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://texaswalkabout.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://buffer.com/add?text=How%20to%20get%20a%20stuck%20cowboy%20boot%20off%3F%20(Explained)&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fhow-to-get-a-stuck-cowboy-boot-off%2F" class="js-share buffer" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://texaswalkabout.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#buffer"/></svg> <span>Buffer</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=How%20to%20get%20a%20stuck%20cowboy%20boot%20off%3F%20(Explained) https%3A%2F%2Ftexaswalkabout.com%2Fhow-to-get-a-stuck-cowboy-boot-off%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://texaswalkabout.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/authors/texas-walkabout/" class="invert" rel="author">Texas Walkabout</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://texaswalkabout.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
