They’ve protected our feet and ankles from the forces of nature for centuries. Hiking and cowboy boots are no exception.</p><p>Even though they share similar purposes, how do they compare with one another?</p><p>In this article, we’ll discuss some similarities between the two, the differences, what functions they serve, and if they’re comfortable overall to wear.</p><h2><strong>What similarities do hiking boots and cowboy boots share?</strong></h2><p><strong>They both protect your ankles from the elements.</strong></p><p>If you’re one to splash around in the mud and muck, then either type of boot will serve your purpose just fine. Both are made with durability in mind, meaning they can take a beating and keep on going.</p><p>Since both a cowboy and hiking boot will fully cover your ankle, you’ll be able to walk around in puddles, snow, and anything else that your feet will sink into. It makes sense too, as these two kinds of footwear are used primarily for outdoor purposes.</p><p>Seeing how durable these boots are, you can also expect to wear either pair all day long. If taken care of properly, expect to have your boots last for several years on end.</p><h2><strong>What are the differences between cowboy boots and hiking boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>Their construction materials.</strong></p><p>Traditionally, cowboy boots are made up of <a href="https://horseracingsense.com/are-cowboy-boots-comfortable/">leather</a>. Hiking boots, on the other hand, are made up of <a href="https://coolofthewild.com/hiking-shoes-vs-boots/">synthetic alternatives</a> such as GORE-TEX to make them more waterproof. They also contain <em>some</em> leather, but not nearly as much as a traditional pair of cowboy boots.</p><p>Even if both can be worn outside for long periods of time, their functions differ somewhat. Hiking boots are designed to handle some of the roughest terrain out there, whereas cowboy boots need flatter ground to work properly. This is due to the outer soles of hiking boots having better grip.</p><h2><strong>How do the prices of each boot compare?</strong></h2><p><strong>Both are relatively the same.</strong></p><p>With that being said, it also depends which pair you buy for either type. Some pairs might be made of higher-quality materials, and will therefore cost more. However, for those common everyday kinds of boots, both <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cowboy+boots&amp;crid=2R84HOQBNEQ7O&amp;sprefix=cowboy+boots%2Caps%2C132&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1">cowboy</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=hiking+boots&amp;crid=PB3V5SF70CWM&amp;sprefix=hiking+boot%2Caps%2C138&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1">hiking</a> boots have an average range of 50 to 200 dollars.</p><p>Should you consider buying a pair of either, it’s up to you how much you want to spend. Do you want quality over everything else? Be prepared to spend triple-digit dollar numbers. In some cases, the best quality cowboy boots can exceed well over a <a href="https://lucchese.com/">grand</a>!</p><p>If you’re not outdoors ninety percent of the time, then consider getting a cheaper pair of boots instead. If you won’t use your boots much, cowboy or hiking, then don’t be afraid to spend 50 bucks or less. That way you don’t have to break your bank account for durable footwear.</p><h2><strong>What functions does each kind of boot serve?</strong></h2><p><strong>Different designs, different functions.</strong></p><p>As it says in the name, “Hiking”, boots are intended for long hikes on uneven terrain. Seriously, consider getting a pair if you’ll be traveling on snowy, rocky, or even high alpine surfaces.</p><p>Cowboy boots, however, won’t do so well in those kinds of environments. Some complain about <a href="https://scoutlife.org/outdoors/ask-the-gear-guy/148814/wear-cowboy-boots-on-a-hike/">the lack of traction</a> for what’s needed on hikes. As cowboy boots don’t have the grip that hiking boots have, it would be a bad idea to walk up a mountain with improper footwear. Even though cowboy boots are made to endure tough situations, they’re mostly intended for things like riding horses or working on a ranch.</p><p>If you break into them right, you can use either cowboy or hiking boots to walk long distances. One function that both types share is their ability to last long hours in the great outdoors.</p><h2><strong>How comfortable is either type?</strong></h2><p><strong>It depends on the type you get.</strong></p><p>How comfortable any footwear is depends on the size and shape of your feet, and how you use your boots. Higher-quality goods, no matter what kind of boot, tend to be a bit more comfortable than the cheaper alternatives.</p><p>With that being said, hiking boots overall tend to be <a href="https://www.fromtheguestroom.com/can-you-wear-cowboy-boots-every-day/">more comfortable</a> than cowboy boots. This comes as no surprise, considering what hiking boots are designed to do. Whereas some brands of cowboy boots come with cushioning, most won’t have too much of it. To make them more comfortable, you’ll have to consider buying extra padding for that bit of extra comfort.</p><h2><strong>What are some of the best brands for both hiking and cowboy boots?</strong></h2><p><strong>There are several.</strong></p><p>For cowboy boots, some brands to check out are Justin and <a href="https://cowboylifestylenetwork.com/top-5-best-cowboy-boot-brands/">Lucchese</a>. Other quality companies also include Ariat, Rocketbuster, and Corral. These five brands are considered some of the best cowboy bootmakers around.</p><p>The top five hiking boot brands (as of 2022) are <a href="https://besthiking.net/best-hiking-boot-brands/">Zamberlan</a>, Lowa, La Sportiva, Merrel, and Salomon. If you need footwear that will last an entire day of backpacking and then some, give each of these companies a look.</p><h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>Whereas each kind of boot is great for wearing around outside, always keep the terrain in mind, as each type of footwear is designed to tackle different purposes. Which boot fits best for <em>you</em> depends on what you need them <em>for</em>. Shopping around for the best of either might seem like a headache at first, but now that you have a little more knowledge than before, explore a little bit!</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__tag"><h3 class="post__tag__title">Posted in</h3><ul class="post__tag__list"><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/cowboy-boot/">Cowboy Boots</a></li><li><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/tags/texas/">Western Wear</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://texaswalkabout.com/how-to-keep-cowboy-boots-from-rubbing-leg/" class="invert">How to keep cowboy boots from rubbing leg?
